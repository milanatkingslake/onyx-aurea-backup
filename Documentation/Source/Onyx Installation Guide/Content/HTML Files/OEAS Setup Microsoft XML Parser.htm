        <h2>OEAS Setup: Microsoft XML Parser 4.0 Error</h2>
        <p>When running the OEAS Setup, the following error message may appear:</p>
        <p><i>Microsoft XML Parser 4.0 has not been installed on this machine. Therefore, Avolin cannot support your current configuration.</i>
        </p>
        <p>This message appears when you try to run the Onyx Setup program without having met the requirement for MSXML version specified in the Onyx System Requirements.</p>
        <p>If you get this message, do not continue with the Setup. Install MSXML 4.0 and then restart the OEAS Setup program.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">If you need to restart the Onyx Enterprise Database Setup, either create a new database with a new name, or delete the database you created and then recreate it with the backup of the database. If you try to use the same database in a subsequent run of the OEDB Setup program after it has failed, you may get a severe error that blocks completion of the database Setup.</p>
