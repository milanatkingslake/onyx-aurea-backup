        <h2>Verifying Prerequisites</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>On your OEAS server, make sure that you have a valid SSL Certificate in store.</li>
            <li>Configure HTTPS settings for the certificate in IIS and note the port number you are using for the configuration.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="ListNote" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">If you are using a common Web/App server, then ensure that you configure different ports for OEP and for the HTTPS certificate.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Ensure that each iOS client device also has the same SSL certificate installed.</li>
            <li>Ensure all users are logged off from Onyx and stop the OGS service.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="ListNote" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Most certificates issues by a trusted authority are usually pre-installed on iOS client devices. If you have a self signed security certificate, you will need to manually install this on the iOS device.</p>
