        <p>The <b>Search</b> screen allows users to enter specific criteria to search for Company, Individual, and Incident records from their iOS or Android device. Users can perform a search based on several criteria such as ID, name, address, e-mail, location, and type.</p>
        <p>The fields and tasks available on the <b>Search </b>screen depend on the configuration made within the XML file corresponding to the screen. Use this information to configure XML files for <b>Customer Search</b> screens.</p>
        <p>To configure the fields that are displayed in the <b>Customer Search Result List</b> screen, see <a href="XML_Files_List.htm">Configuring List Screens</a>.</p>
