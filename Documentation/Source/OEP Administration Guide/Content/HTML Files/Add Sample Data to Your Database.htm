        <h3><a name="top"></a>Add Sample Data to Your Database</h3>
        <p><a href="Accessing UCW.htm#top">Accessing UCW</a> is as easy as navigating to the UCW-enabled area of OEP that you want to configure and clicking <img src="../Resources/Images/ONYX 77 OEP Administration Guide/Add Sample Data to Your Database.png" style="width: 23px;height: 22px;" />. To test certain pages that you configure, however, data must exist in the database. For example, a company record must exist before you can test the Company Edit page. Therefore, it’s a good idea to add a few records to your database before you begin to configure OEP.</p>
        <p>Using OES Product Administration, add the following data to the OEDB:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a product</li>
            <li>an incident product for a sales incident</li>
            <li>an incident product for a service incident</li>
            <li>an incident product for a support incident</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using OES Reference Table Administration, add lookup values for the following items:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>type (The type of the incident, such as Recurring or Single Occurrence. This is different than an incident category.)</li>
            <li>status (The status of the incident, such as Open or Closed.)</li>
            <li>priority (The priority of the incident, such as High, Medium, Low.)</li>
            <li>source (The source of the incident, such as Direct or Referral.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using OEP, add at least one record of each of the following types: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>company</li>
            <li>individual</li>
            <li>product</li>
            <li>a sales incident associated with either a company or individual record</li>
            <li>a service incident associated with either a company or individual record</li>
            <li>a support incident associated with either a company or individual record</li>
            <li>a task associated with any incident record that you created</li>
        </ul>
