        <h1><a name="top"></a>Configuring Layout</h1>
        <p>You can configure the page layout of any <a href="Configuring OEP.htm#top">UCW-enabled OEP page</a>, as well as any <a href="Deleting toolbars.htm#Configur">new tab</a> that you add to a UCW-enabled page using canvases, panels, and sections. A canvas defines the structure, or layout, of a page. Using <a href="Using Canvas Designer.htm#top">Canvas Designer</a>, you can configure the layout of any UCW-enabled page.</p>
        <p>It may be helpful to think of a canvas as a table that consists of columns, rows, and cells. In the UCW environment, however, cells are referred to as panels. A canvas can have any number of panels, and each panel can contain any number of sections. You can also convert a panel into a canvas, which in turn can contain additional panels and sections. Because there is no limit to the number of canvases, panels, and sections that you may add to a page, you will want to put your UI design skills to work to ensure that you're creating a page that your users will find to be both useful and intuitive.</p>
        <p>When you enter design mode from any UCW-enabled page, various design elements indicate how the page has been designed. Each UI control is identified by a marker of its own, and each canvas, panel, and section is framed in a different color: &#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="Working with Canvases.htm#top" style="font-weight: bold;">Canvases</a> are framed in red. The top-left corner of each canvas is marked by a red triangle (<img src="../Resources/Images/ONYX 77 OEP Administration Guide/Configuring Layout.png" style="width: 10px;height: 10px;" />) that, when right-clicked, displays a list of actions that you can perform on that canvas.</li>
            <li><a href="Working with Panels.htm#top" style="font-weight: bold;">Panels</a> are framed in green. The top-left corner of each panel is marked by a green triangle (<img src="../Resources/Images/ONYX 77 OEP Administration Guide/Configuring Layout_1.png" style="width: 10px;height: 10px;" />) that, when right-clicked, displays a list of actions that you can perform on that panel. It also serves as a drop-spot for UI controls, captions, or sections that are dragged to it.</li>
            <li><a href="Working with Sections.htm#top" style="font-weight: bold;">Sections</a> are framed in blue. The top-left corner of each section is marked by a blue triangle (<img src="../Resources/Images/ONYX 77 OEP Administration Guide/Configuring Layout_2.png" style="width: 10px;height: 10px;" />) that, when right-clicked, displays a list of actions that you can perform on that section. It also serves as a drop-spot for UI controls or captions that are dragged to it, and as a drag handle that enables you to drag the section to another location within the panel or to another panel.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 style="page-break-before: always;">Sample layout</h4>
        <p>The following graphic shows a sample Edit Company page in design mode.</p>

            <img src="../Resources/Images/ONYX 77 OEP Administration Guide/image5.png" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #000000;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #000000;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #000000;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #000000;width: 556px;height: 376px;" />
        </p>
        <p>If you were to use <a href="Using Canvas Designer.htm#top">Canvas Designer</a> to create a page with this same structure, your canvas would look like this:</p>
