        <h2><a name="top"></a>Using OTMHelper Classes</h2>
        <p>The OTMHelper classes abstract interaction with the Onyx Transaction Manager (OTM). These classes provide methods for establishing a logical connection with the OTM, packaging requests for business object operations, and processing the resulting data. The OEP architecture is designed to work with record-oriented data. The OTMHelper classes serve as a means for dealing with business objects, which are represented in XML data structures, in a record-oriented manner. </p>
        <p class="Important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">This section assumes you are familiar with the underlying principles of interacting with the OTM. You should be familiar with the OEAS Developer's Reference and have an understanding of how business objects operate.</p>
        <p>There are two versions of the OTMHelper classes, server-side and client-side. The two versions are identical, apart from the two methods <i href="file:///C:/Users/rmuladharmaveer/Documents/MyJabberFiles/arunkumar.vasam@aptean.com/ONYX 77 OEP Administration Guide.doc#_Ref307054550">bExecuteLocal</i> and <i href="file:///C:/Users/rmuladharmaveer/Documents/MyJabberFiles/arunkumar.vasam@aptean.com/ONYX 77 OEP Administration Guide.doc#_Ref1070389012">bExecuteRemote</i>. For this reason, code that uses the OTMHelper classes can be implemented on either the client or server side, and moved back and forth easily.</p>
        <p>ASP pages use the server-side OTMHelper classes. These scripts create an XML document on the server side, pass it to an instance of the Onyx Transaction Manager object, and process the resulting XML data before sending HTML to the client.</p>
        <p>The client-side OTMHelper classes are used in browser scripting. They create an XML document and pass it to a special server-side ASP page via XMLHTTP, which in turn passes it to the Onyx Transaction Manager object. The resulting XML data is returned to the browser for formatting and/or processing.</p>
