        <h2>Primary Navigation</h2>
        <p>The Navigation Bar and the Header Bar are a part of the basic frame layout of the OEP application. They enable users to select a feature to load either in the Data Area frame or in a separate window. </p>
        <p>The <b>Navigation Bar</b> works with a two-level tree structure. Top-level elements are known as groups. Elements within groups are known simply as items. The items provide links to customer-related features. The Navigation Bar appears in its own frame on the left side of the main OEP window. </p>
        <p>The <b>Header Bar</b> appears in the Logo/Graphic frame of the OEP window and contains links to the most commonly used features of the application. Unlike the Navigation Bar, which has a hierarchy and text-only links, the Header Bar has a single row of buttons that identify the link's target. </p>
        <h4>Configuring the navigation features</h4>
        <p>Using the <a href="Configuring Page Navigation.htm#top">Navigation Designer</a>, one of several UCW tools, you can configure Navigation Bar elements, Header Bar buttons, and other UI navigation controls. The Navigation Designer provides a user interface for you to add, modify, and delete the navigation elements. These modifications are automatically applied when you upgrade to future versions of OEP.</p>
