        <h3>Deploy OEP</h3>
        <p>After you've prepared your OEP production environment for use, you're ready to deploy OEP to your users. </p>
        <h4>Deployment suggestions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Before deploying OEP to your users, consider offering an training course to get your users up and running quickly</li>
            <li>Inform your users of our recommendations for client OEP users and what to expect when printing and emailing UCW-configured pages</li>
            <li>If you're upgrading from an earlier version of OEP, inform your users that they must clear their Internet Explorer caches of OEP data before launching the new version of OEP</li>
            <li>Provide each OEP user with the following logon credentials:</li>
            <li class="List_Indent">Logon ID and password (not necessary if you're using integrated Windows authentication)</li>
            <li class="List_Indent">OEP profile(s)</li>
        </ul>
