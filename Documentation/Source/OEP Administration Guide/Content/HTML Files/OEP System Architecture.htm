        <h2>OEP System Architecture</h2>
        <p>Before you begin to work with OEP, it's important to understand how it fits into the Onyx Internet application framework. </p>
        <p>The Onyx Internet application framework is separated into three logical tiers. This tiered architecture (also known as an n-tier architecture) reduces the overhead of round-trip communications with the central application server, as is typical of the traditional two-tier client/server model. &#160;&#160;</p>
        <p><b>Presentation services</b>. The presentation services tier presents information to, and provides interaction with, the end user. This tier handles all data display, user input, and Web services hosting. </p>
        <p><b>OEP resides in this tier</b>. OEP is an ASP-based application (using both classic ASP and .NET components) running on Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS). Users access the application through Internet Explorer. OEP uses DHTML, ActiveX controls, XML, and XSL as part of the presentation tier. </p>
        <p><b>Business services</b>. The business services tier provides reusable application logic that can be used by all presentation services. This includes messaging services, data access, and component services such as transaction management. Data is retrieved from the data store by the business services, which in turn pass the data to the presentation services for interaction with end users. Because the business services tier acts as a broker of information between the presentation services and data services tiers, it is often referred to as the middle tier. </p>
        <p>The Onyx Enterprise Application Server (OEAS) is the primary component of the business services tier. OEAS is a Microsoft COM+ application running on Microsoft Windows 2000 or Windows 2003. </p>
        <p><b>Data services</b>. The data services tier provides the ability to define, store, retrieve, and synchronize data. </p>
        <p>The Onyx Enterprise Database (OEDB) is the primary component of the data services tier. </p>
