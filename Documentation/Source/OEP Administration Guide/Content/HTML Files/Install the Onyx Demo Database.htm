        <h3>Install the Onyx Demo Database</h3>
        <p>Before launching OEP to explore its user interface and understand how it works, consider installing the Onyx Demo Database (Demo.bak) to your Onyx Enterprise Database (OEDB) server.</p>
        <p>The Onyx Demo Database gets you up and running quickly by helping you understand how the OEDB is structured and how applications like OEP and OES interact with it. The database is a sample SQL Server 2012 database that contains default data and sample transactional data. Using this database, you can explore each and every feature in OEP. </p>
        <p>You can certainly explore OEP without installing the Onyx Demo Database, but if you do you will need to create some records of your own before you can use certain features. For example, you won't be able to view or use product records in OEP until product records exist in the database (to create your own product records, use OES Product Administration). </p>
        <p class="Important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Use the Onyx Demo Database for instructional purposes only. It is not intended to be used as a development database, because it contains data that you likely won't want to migrate to your production environment. </p>
        <p>To learn more about the Onyx Demo Database, read the OEDB Demo Database Readme located on the OEAS product CD.</p>
