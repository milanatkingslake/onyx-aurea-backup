        <h2><a name="top"></a>Customization Guidelines Overview</h2>
        <p>By following these guidelines, consultants, partners, and customers can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rapidly develop new features and modifications</li>
            <li>Easily identify existing customizations</li>
            <li>Avoid upgrade hassles by following standard methods of addressing customizations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The OEP product CD provide all OEP user interface code, and you can modify the OEP code as needed. Custom code will need to be re-implemented when you upgrade to the next version of OEP, so be sure to place your customizations into a custom directory to facilitate the upgrade process. </p>
        <p class="Warning" MadCap:autonum=" &#160;&#160;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"> Although it is possible to customize all OEP areas, do not modify <a href="Configuring OEP.htm#UCW">UCW-enabled areas</a> without using <a href="Configuring OEP.htm#top">UCW</a>. UCW configurations are applied automatically when you upgrade to new versions of OEP. Non-UCW customizations are not applied automatically when you upgrade and can cause unpredictable results.</p>
