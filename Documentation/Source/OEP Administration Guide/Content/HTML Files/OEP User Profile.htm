        <h2><a name="top"></a>OEP User Profile</h2>
        <p>The OEP User profile is a security element that provides access to the OEP User UI, a profile-specific UI. The OEP User UI is the only profile-specific UI provided with the installation of OEP. </p>
        <p>If you upgraded from an earlier version of OEP, your users may have automatically been assigned to this profile (users who belong to OEP.Administrator, OEP.PowerUser, and OEP.User roles are automatically assigned to the OEP User profile). If you plan to configure custom UIs for several teams in your organization, however, you must <a href="Create Custom OEP Profiles.htm#top">create additional OEP profiles</a> and then assign your users to these new OEP profiles as desired.</p>
        <p>Like all custom UIs, the appearance, behavior, and other such characteristics of the OEP User UI depend on the modifications made to both it and the baseline UI. </p>
        <p>In the default installation of OEP, the OEP User UI has the same configuration as the baseline UI: their individual edit page, incident edit pages, Header Bars, and so on, are identical. Configure the OEP User UI as desired to meet your company's needs, or create your own OEP profiles and configure them as desired. </p>
        <p>The OEP User profile is available to users who have been granted access to any of the following OEP roles: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>OEP.Administrator</li>
            <li>OEP.PowerUser</li>
            <li>OEP.user</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The OEP User profile is listed among the OEP Profiles defined within OES Security Administration. </p>
