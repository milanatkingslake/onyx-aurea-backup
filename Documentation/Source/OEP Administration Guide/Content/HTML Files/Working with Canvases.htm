        <h2><a name="top"></a>Working with Canvases</h2>
        <p>Canvases are framed in red. The top-left corner of each canvas is marked by a red triangle (<img src="../Resources/Images/ONYX 77 OEP Administration Guide/Configuring Layout.png" style="width: 10px;height: 10px;" />) that, when right-clicked, displays a list of actions that you can perform on that canvas.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">What would you like to do?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#Create">Create a canvas</a> (convert a panel into canvas)</li>
            <li><a href="#Remove">Remove a canvas</a> (convert the canvas to a panel)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Procedures</h3>
        <h4><a name="Create"></a>Create a canvas (convert a panel into a canvas)</h4>
        <p>Create a canvas to design the layout of the page (or certain area of the page). You can create a canvas from any panel of a UCW-enabled page or tab. To create a canvas, you convert an existing panel into a canvas; you can't create a canvas from scratch. &#160;&#160;</p>
        <p class="Tip" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Converting a panel into a canvas removes all UI controls from that panel. Because data binding for toolbox controls is removed as well, you may want to temporarily relocate the controls to another panel to save them for future use. </p>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading" style="page-break-before: always;">To convert a panel into a canvas:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Locate the panel that you want to convert to a canvas.</li>
            <li>If the panel contains toolbox controls that you may want to use later, drag the controls to another panel.</li>
            <li>Right-click the panel's green triangle (<img src="../Resources/Images/ONYX 77 OEP Administration Guide/Configuring Layout_1.png" style="width: 10px;height: 10px;" />) and select Convert to Canvas.</li>
            <li>Using Canvas Designer, <a href="Using Canvas Designer.htm#Design">design the canvas</a> as desired.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4><a name="Remove"></a>Remove a canvas (convert the canvas to a panel)</h4>
        <p>You can't exactly remove a canvas from a page, but you can convert the canvas into a panel. When you change a canvas into a panel, all configurations for that canvas are lost. </p>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To convert to panel:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Locate the canvas that you want to convert to a panel.</li>
            <li>If the canvas contains toolbox controls that you may want to use later, drag the controls to another canvas.</li>
            <li>Right-click the canvas's red triangle (<img src="../Resources/Images/ONYX 77 OEP Administration Guide/Configuring Layout.png" style="width: 10px;height: 10px;" />), and select Convert to Panel.</li>
