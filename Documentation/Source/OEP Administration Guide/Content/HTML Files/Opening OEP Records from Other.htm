        <h2>Opening OEP Records from Other Applications</h2>
        <p>OEP provides a mechanism from which non-browser applications can call OEP to retrieve database records or open blank forms for data entry. There are two files on the Web server that can be used as shortcut entry points to some of the edit windows within OEP. The shortcuts can also be used to perform simple record searches. To learn more about using these shortcuts, click a topic in the list below. </p>
        <h3>Access Methods</h3>
        <p>An external application can access OEP by opening one of two files located on the Web server. Each shortcut file represents a different method for accessing OEP. The first, known as the direct method, is for applications that can create an instance of a browser window with a name property that can be referenced using standard DHTML script tools. Generally this requires that the calling application is either already running within an instance of Internet Explorer, or is able to create one through OLE automation (for example, from within a Microsoft Office application using Visual Basic for Applications, or from any COM-enabled Win32 application). &#160;</p>
        <p>The second method, known as the indirect method, is for applications that use the Windows Explorer shell to open a browser through a file association of type URL. A common example of this is clicking a URL from within an email opened in a third party application. The indirect method is less desirable because it requires OEP to open a temporary window which then calls the direct method. This temporary window remains open and is effectively abandoned by OEP when the user begins working with the new window. The user must manually close the temporary window to remove it from the desktop. </p>
