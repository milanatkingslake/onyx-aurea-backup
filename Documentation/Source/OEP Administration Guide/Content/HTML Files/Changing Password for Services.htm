        <h3>Changing Password for Services</h3>
        <p>When you run the OEAS Config, the passwords you enter for OGS and ONS connectivity to the database, as well as to the EWS and SMTP server are stored in encrypted form in the respective configuration files. Use the Password Encrypt utility included with your installation to change these passwords after installation.</p>
        <p><b>To change the password:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>In your Onyx installation package, navigate to Utilities and copy the PassEncrypt folder to your OEAS server.</li>
            <li>Ensure that the privatekey.pvk and publickey.puk files are Read Only.</li>
            <li>On your OEAS server, open Command Prompt and change the directory to the copied location.</li>
            <li>Run the following command to generate the encrypted password.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li class="List_Indent">Replace [PUK path] with the path where you copied the publickey.puk file.</li>
            <li class="List_Indent">Replace [password] with the new password in plain text.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1"><code>Passencrypt.exe /e /puk "[PUK path]" /p [password in plain text] /pr yes</code>
        </p>
