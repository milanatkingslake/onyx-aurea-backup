        <h1><a name="top"></a>Configure or Customize OEP?</h1>
        <p>You know that you want to modify OEP, but should you configure it, or customize it? What's the difference?</p>
        <p><b>Configuring OEP</b>. Essentially, configuration tasks are those that can be accomplished using an Onyx tool such as UCW, OES, or any of the many other Onyx tools and utilities. Some configuration tasks require you to modify existing code or write some of code of your own, but in cases like these, the code writing can be done exclusively within a tool (as is the case with writing custom JavaScript within the UCW Dynamic Forms Designer). For details, see the <a href="Configuring OEP.htm#top">Configuring OEP</a> book.</p>
        <p><b>Customizing OEP</b>. Customization tasks, on the other hand, are those that cannot be accomplished using an Onyx tool and must therefore be done by writing your own custom code. Customizing OEP requires an understanding of the <a href="Programmer s Reference.htm#top">OEP programmer's reference</a>, just as customizing OEAS requires knowledge of the OEAS reference libraries (which are documented in the OEAS Technical Reference). For details, see the <a href="Customizing the OEP Client.htm#top">Customizing OEP</a> book.</p>
        <p>Still, it may be unclear in certain circumstances whether you should configure OEP using UCW, or whether you should customize OEP by writing custom code. Consider the following guidelines when making your decision.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>...if you plan to modify a <a href="Configuring OEP.htm#UCW">UCW-enabled area</a> of OEP</li>
            <li>...if you want to modify how users <a href="Configuring Page Navigation.htm#top">navigate</a> through OEP (using the Header Bar and Navigation Bar)</li>
            <li>...if you want to modify the <a href="Configuring Page Appearance.htm#top">appearance</a> of OEP</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Customize OEP ...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>...if you plan to modify an area of OEP that is not UCW-enabled</li>
            <li>...if you want to create a new OEP page</li>
            <li>...if you want to modify an OEP page so dramatically that it deserves to be a new, custom page</li>
        </ul>
