        <h3><a name="top"></a>Navigator Search Criteria Administration</h3>
        <p>For each Search Type available in Navigator, you can limit the fields that will be available to users to perform a search. You can also change the default field names to ones that are better suited to your organization's requirements. These options are available only if you are logged on as a user with administrative privileges.</p>

        <h4><a name="Determin"></a>Determine available search criteria</h4>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To determine search criteria</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the <b>Search Criteria Field Selection and Administration</b> window. To do this, in the Navigator <b>Search Criteria</b> window, select a <b>Search Type</b>, click <img src="../Resources/Images/ONYX 77 OEP Administration Guide/Navigator Search Criteria.png" style="width: 23px;height: 23px;" />, and then click Search Criteria.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">The <b>Selected</b> column lists the fields that are currently available to users as default <b>search criteria</b>. These fields display in the <b>Search Criteria</b> window when you select the search type. The <b>Available</b> column lists the fields that can be included as search criteria. The <b>Disabled</b> column lists the fields that cannot be included as search criteria.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>To make a field available as a search criterion, select and drag it to the <b>Available</b> column.</li>
            <li>To include a field as a default search criterion that displays in the Search window, select and drag it to the <b>Selected</b> column.</li>
            <li>To remove a field as a default search criterion, but to keep it available for users to add, select and drag it to the <b>Available</b> column.</li>
            <li>To completely remove a field as a search criterion, select and drag it to the <b>Disabled</b> column.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">Some fields may share hierarchical relationships with other fields. To understand how such fields are moved from one list to another, see <a href="#Understa">Understanding hierarchical relationships</a>.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Save your changes or click <img src="../Resources/Images/ONYX 77 OEP Administration Guide/Navigator Search Criteria_1.png" style="width: 16px;height: 17px;" /> to restore the default search criteria, and close the window.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4><a name="Understa"></a>Understanding hierarchical relationships</h4>
        <p>The search criteria may include fields that are hierarchical, that is, the values in those fields depend upon values entered in other fields. For example, since the values for the field State depend on the value for the field Country, Country is the parent field for the dependent field State. This hierarchy can exist at several levels; therefore, a field can be a parent field as well as a dependent field. For example, in a hierarchy of Resolution Code 1 - Resolution Code 2 - Resolution Code 3, the field Resolution Code 2 is a parent for the field Resolution Code 3, but a dependent for the field Resolution Code 1.</p>
        <p>You can move a parent field from one column to anyone of the other two columns. When you move a parent field, the associated child fields move along with the parent field, but you cannot move a child field alone. </p>
