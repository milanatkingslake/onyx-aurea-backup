        <h2><a name="top"></a>Global Profile</h2>
        <p>The Global profile is a security element that provides UCW designers access to the baseline UI. Only one baseline UI is provided with the installation of OEP. </p>
        <p>Configurations made to the baseline UI apply to all profile-specific UIs (including the OEP User UI provided with the installation of OEP), whereas configurations made to a profile-specific UI apply to that UI only. The baseline UI is not visible to OEP users. </p>
        <p>Let's say, for instance, that you have created several different OEP profiles and that you want to make the same modification to all profile-specific UIs. You can accomplish this task by making the change just once—in the baseline UI (accessed with the Global profile)—since all changes to the baseline UI are automatically applied to all profile-specific UIs. As we recommend in our best practices, it's usually best to <a href="Tips Tricks.htm#Configure">configure the baseline UI first</a>, and then configure your various profile-specific UIs</p>
        <p>When configuring OEP for the various teams in your organization, determine whether you want the configuration to apply to all profile-specific UIs, or to just one or several profile-specific UIs. If you want the configuration to apply to all profile-specific UIs, log on to OEP using the Global profile and make your changes to the baseline UI. To configure a profile-specific UI, log on to OEP using the related OEP profile. </p>
        <p>The Global profile is available to UCW designers and other users who have been granted access to either the OEP.administrator role or the UI:OEP.ucw.configure resource. The Global profile is not accessible by OEP users, nor is it listed among the OEP Profiles defined within OES Security Administration. The Global profile is not generally accessible in the production environment, although UCW designers with appropriate access privileges can log on to a production installation of OEP to set <a href="Setting Default OEP User Preferences.htm#top">default OEP user preferences</a>.</p>
