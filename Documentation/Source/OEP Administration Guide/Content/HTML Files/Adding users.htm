        <h4>Adding users</h4>
        <p>Use OES Security Administration to add users to the Onyx database. For detailed instructions, see the OES online Help.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Before adding users to your database, you may want to contact <a href="http://support.aptean.com/selfservice">Onyx Product Support</a> to determine if you need to purchase additional Onyx licenses.</p>
        <p><b>To add users:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Launch OES Security Administration.</li>
            <li>Create one or more groups, as desired.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">You typically assign Onyx users to groups. Groups are hierarchical classifications of users, and may or may not correspond to actual departments or teams within your organization. Note that users can belong to only one group.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Create one or more roles, as desired, and define each role by granting them access to various resources.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">Onyx users can be assigned to one or more roles. Roles, like groups, may or may not correspond directly to actual roles within your organization. Here, roles pertain to OEP and to the role(s) of each user who uses OEP. You can use roles as a means to manage security and access to data, as well as a means to drive business rules. Users can belong to any number of roles. </p>
        <p class="Indent1">For example, many users in your organization will likely share the same set of access permissions, since they will generally use the same set of OEP functionality. Other users in your organization, however, such as those in your Finance and Sales departments, may require additional access permissions to OEP functionality. And yet another set of users, such as OEP administrators, database administrators, and UCW designers, require access permissions not only to the standard set of OEP functionality, but also to OES, OPS, and possibly other tools, as well. You can also use roles to drive business rules, such as by sending a sales contract to your legal advisor when you approach the final stage of a sales deal. </p>
        <p class="Indent1">OEP provides several default roles to which you can assign users. You may, however, want to create entirely custom roles to suit your needs. Configure each role by granting or denying access to specific resources.</p>
        <p class="Indent1">Note that each role that you create must be granted permission to the “UI:OEP.Logon” resource, either directly or by membership in a role with permissions to that resource. Users without permission to that resource cannot log on to OEP. You may also want to assign each role to at least one OEP profile (unless you want to assign individual users to their appropriate OEP profile), since users must be assigned to at least one OEP profile in order to log on to OEP. &#160;</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Create the appropriate Onyx user accounts for each group that you created earlier. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">When creating an Onyx user account, be aware of certain OEP account limitations.</p>
        <p class="Indent1">For each user, you must indicate whether the user account will be authenticated using Onyx authentication or integrated Windows authentication.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Add each user to one or more roles, as desired.</li>
            <li>Grant/deny each user to additional resources, to either permit or restrict their access to additional functionality.</li>
            <li>Ensure that each user is assigned to at least one OEP profile, either directly or by membership in a role that is assigned to at least one OEP profile, otherwise they cannot log on to OEP.</li>
        </ol>
