        <h2><a name="top"></a>Adding a Custom Toolbar Button</h2>
        <p>This customization shows how to add a button to the toolbar on the Survey Details page. The code within the custom files assumes that the company business object has been modified to store stock ticker symbol data in the property user5. If your implementation stores this data in a different property, modify the sample file YourOEPwebsite/Examples/Toolbar/customaction.js.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">For details on adding a custom toolbar button to a <a href="Configuring OEP.htm#UCW">UCW-enabled</a> page, see <a href="Creating a Tab.htm#Adding2">Adding toolbar buttons and other items</a>.</p>
        <h4>Modifying surveys_details.asp</h4>
        <p>Toolbar buttons on the PowerPage are created by the code within <i>YourOEPwebsite</i>/powerpage/surveys_details.asp. The icons are arranged within a table and stored within IMG elements with JavaScript functions attached to various events. The code also checks for specific permissions before adding some of the buttons to the toolbar. If the user does not have sufficient permissions, the button is omitted from the output HTML.</p>
        <p>There are three places in survey_details.asp that must be modified for this example.</p>
