        <h3>Add Domain Data</h3>
        <p>Before you begin to modify OEP, determine what domain data you want to add to your OEP system. Some of your OEP modifications will likely depend on the domain data that you add to your system. </p>
        <p class="Important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Each domain data value is assigned a unique ID in the database. It is imperative that these unique IDs are maintained between development, test, and production environments, otherwise unpredictable results may occur. For additional details, see the OEP Installation Guide. </p>
        <p>Default installations of OEP include standard domain data such as country codes, region codes, and currency types. It also includes domain data that defines customer types and subtypes (such as Financial/Bank and Financial/Credit Union) and various types of literature that your company may make available to your customers. You will almost certainly want to add the domain data for each product and service that your company offers to your customers, as well as many other types of domain data to support your daily transactions. &#160;</p>
        <p>You can use OES to create additional domain data, or to modify existing domain data to make it more relevant to your business. For details about the various OES tools, see the OEAS Technical Reference.</p>
