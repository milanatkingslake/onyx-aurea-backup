        <h2><a name="Viewing"></a>Viewing Appointment Logs</h2>
        <p>You can view the event log for calendar appointments in Windows Event Viewer. SQL CLR trigger events are logged on your database server while ONS&#160;events are logged on the application server.</p>
        <p>SQL CLR events on the database server can be identified by Source = Onyx.CLR and Event ID = 243.</p>
        <p>Logs for calendar appointments are stored in the Persistence database. You can use this information to view the status of an appointment, as well as to view and resolve errors. You can also export this information for auditing and security checks.</p>
        <p>The following tables in the Persistence database store logs of notification emails and calendar appointments that are sent to users.</p>

        <h2><a name="Modifyin"></a>Modifying Appointment Templates</h2>
        <p>Based on your organization's requirement, you can control the information that is sent to users in their calendar appointments. Use the Templates.config file to define the subject and body of each calendar appointment that is sent to Onyx users. For each calendar appointment, you can specify the tables, XML, and HTML files from which data is populated.</p>
        <p>For a list of profile XML and HTML template files for appointments, see <a href="#Template">Template files</a>.</p>
        <p>To add fields to templates, you must modify the following files:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="Modifying Template Configuration.htm#top">Template Config file</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="Adding Profile XML File.htm#Modifyin">Profile XML files</a>

            <li><a href="Modifying HTML Template Files.htm#top">HTML Template files</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To remove fields from templates, see <a href="#Removing">Removing fields from templates</a>.</p>
        <h3><a name="Template"></a>Template Files</h3>
        <p>Onyx uses profile XML and HTML template files to control the information that users receive in their calendar appointments. These files are located within the Onyx installation folder on the OEAS server.</p>
        <p>The default path for profile XML files is: C:\Program Files\Onyx\AppServer\Applications\Onyx\OnyxNotificationService\Profiles.</p>
        <p>The default path for HTML template files is: C:\Program Files\Onyx\AppServer\Applications\Onyx\OnyxNotificationService\Templates.</p>
        <p>You can configure Onyx to send appointment notifications in plain text format. The default plain text templates are included in your installation package under Customization Support&gt;Application Server (OEAS)&gt;OnyxNotificationService&gt;PlainTextTemplates. For information about configuring Onyx to use plain text templates, see <a href="Modifying Template Configuration.htm#top">Modifying the template configuration file.</a></p>
