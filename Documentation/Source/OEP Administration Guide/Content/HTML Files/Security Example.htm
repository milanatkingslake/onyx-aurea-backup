        <h2><a name="top"></a>Security Example</h2>
        <p>The security example demonstrates how to secure ASP pages within the OEP architecture in order to prevent unauthorized access. In this example, you attempt to access a secure page. If you have not yet been authenticated, then you are sent to a logon page. After successful authentication, you are allowed access to the secured page.</p>
        <p>The example scripting illustrates how to include <i>otm_common.asp</i> and call the <i>initializePageSecurity</i> function to perform the security check. The example for the security demonstration is in the customization examples directory in the path Examples\Security\Secure.asp. </p>
