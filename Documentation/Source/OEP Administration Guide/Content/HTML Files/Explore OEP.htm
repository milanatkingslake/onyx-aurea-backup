        <h3>Explore OEP</h3>
        <p>Explore OEPBefore modifying OEP, take some time to familiarize yourself with OEP, its many diverse features, and its architecture. The better you understand how OEP works, the easier it will be to modify. And the better you modify OEP to suit your business needs, the more your users will benefit from a rich user experience.</p>
        <p>There are many avenues to explore OEP. You can begin your journey by taking any one of them.</p>
        <h4>Avenues to explore OEP</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Browse the OEP UI:</b> Whether you're a business analyst, database administrator, or developer, you may find it most useful to begin by exploring the OEP user interface.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">Log in to OEP using [sa/onyx] logon credentials and navigate through the many features of OEP, including the main customer pages, the various incident categories (sales, service, and support), and the Quick Search tool. Then explore the tools that enable you to interact with these records, including Task Manager, List Manager, and Messenger.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Familiarize yourself with OEP's many tools:</b> Review the list of <a href="Customizing OEP.htm#Programm">tools</a> that accompany the OEP and OEAS installations.</li>
            <li><b>Peruse the OEP online Help:</b> Consult OEP's online Help system to learn more about how each OEP feature works.</li>
            <li><b>Learn about the system architecture:</b> As you navigate through OEP and discover more about <a href="What is OEP.htm#top">what OEP is</a>, you may become more interested in how OEP is designed. This guide contains information about the OEP system architecture. For complete details about OEAS and the OEDB, see the OEAS Technical Guide and the OEAS Technical Reference.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">It's important to understand that OEP is just one part of an n-tiered application. N-tier applications are typically divided into three main tiers. The presentation tier, the business logic tier, and the data tier. Keep in mind that although we often discuss OEP as a comprehensive system that spans all three tiers, OEP technically resides only in the presentation tier. The other tiers are comprised of entities that were installed before you installed OEP. The Onyx Enterprise Application Server (OEAS) resides in the business logic tier, and the Onyx Enterprise Database (OEDB) resides in the data tier.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Read this guide:</b> Read all sections of this guide that pertains to you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">The <a href="Configuring OEP.htm#top">Configuring OEP</a> book is useful for everyone who plans to use UCW to configure OEP.</p>
        <p class="Indent1">The <a href="Customizing OEP.htm#top">Customizing OEP</a> book is useful for developers who plan to write code to customize OEP.</p>
        <p class="Indent1">The <a href="Administer OEP.htm#top">Administering OEP</a> book is useful for anyone who is configuring, customizing, administering, or maintaining OEP.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Peruse the OEAS product documentation:</b> The OEAS product CD contains several documents and Help systems that provide detailed information about the business logic and data tiers. Because OEP relies so heavily on these tiers, understanding OEAS and the OEDB will greatly enhance your ability to configure, customize, administer, and maintain OEP.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><b>Explore OES:</b> Explore Onyx Enterprise Studio (OES), which is a collection of tools that is installed along with OEAS. If you are responsible for administering and maintaining OEP, you will be most interested in the OES administration tools. If you are a business analyst or developer, you will likely be interested in both the OES administration and design tools. Online Help is available for each OES tool.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><b>Learn about other Onyx products:</b> If you plan to use other Onyx products, such as BRM, EMF, or the SSRS, familiarize yourself with them, too. Install them, navigate their UIs, and read their accompanying product documentation to determine how they may influence the modifications you make to OEP.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">It's typically best to learn about OEP, OEAS, and the OEDB first, and then learn how other Onyx products interact with the OEP/OEAS platform.</p>
