        <p>OEP users inherit user preference settings that are established for their OEP profile by a special user account called User Preferences Default. Users can override these settings by setting their own user preferences within OEP. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">It's typically better to set default OEP user preferences in your test or production environments rather than in your development environment. If you instead choose to set them in the development environment, you must then migrate the data from your development environment to your test or production environments. &#160;&#160;</p>
        <p>There are two main types of user preferences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>General system preferences:</b> Preferences can be set for various feature areas in OEP. &#160;For instance, one preference specifies your OEP start page, and another preference specifies the default currency type for forecast and quote records. To set preferences such as these, click OEP's Preferences button and adjust your settings as desired.</li>
            <li><b>Result list preferences:</b> Preferences can also be set for result lists, which enables you to define how the retrieved data (per result list) is presented to various users. For instance, you can configure the width of each column of the result list, the order in which each column appears, and whether or not the result list displays a certain column at all. To configure a result list, click the <b>Configure List Settings</b> button located at the bottom of the page, and configure the list as desired.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The User Preferences Default account </h3>
        <p>To set default user preferences, you must first <a href="Enabling the User Preferences.htm#top">enable the User Preferences Default account</a>. You can then set default user preferences for all OEP profiles simultaneously (by logging on to OEP using the Global profile) or for each OEP profile separately (by logging on to OEP using the desired OEP profile).</p>
        <p>The User Preferences Default account is a special user account that is designed for managing only default user preferences; it cannot be used to reset preferences that users set themselves. This means that if you, as administrator, use the User Preferences Default account to modify OEP's default preference settings for a certain UI, users that belong to the OEP profile associated with that UI will inherit only the settings that they have not already defined for themselves. </p>
        <p>For example, if you use the User Preferences Default account to change the Startup View from Home Page to Task Manager, only the OEP users who have not already defined their own preferred Startup View will inherit this change. The next time these users launch OEP, they will see Task Manager as their start page. Users who have selected their own Startup View will continue to see that as their start page.</p>
