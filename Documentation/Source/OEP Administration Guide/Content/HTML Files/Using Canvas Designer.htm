        <h2><a name="top"></a>Using Canvas Designer</h2>
        <p>Canvas Designer enables you to define the layout of a page, or of a certain area of the page. Canvases are comprised of one or more panels organized into columns and rows. Using Canvas Designer, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Specify the number of panels in the canvas</li>
            <li>Organize the panels into any number of rows and columns</li>
            <li>Merge multiple panels into a single panel</li>
            <li>Assign the TAB order for the canvas</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To access Canvas Designer, right-click a panel's green triangle (<img src="../Resources/Images/ONYX 77 OEP Administration Guide/Configuring Layout_1.png" style="width: 10px;height: 10px;" />) and select Convert to Canvas.</p>

        <h4><a name="Design"></a>Design a canvas</h4>
        <p>The design of a page's layout is often driven by users' work flow requirements, which you may have already assessed when <a href="Plan Your OEP Implementation.htm#top">planning your OEP implementation</a>. Because canvases serve as the foundation of page layout, it's important to design them with your users' needs in mind. </p>
        <p>Canvases cannot be edited after they are saved, so design your canvases carefully. If you need to re-design a canvas, you must <a href="Working with Canvases.htm#Remove">convert the canvas to a panel</a>, and then re-create the canvas by <a href="Working with Canvases.htm#Create">converting the panel to a canvas</a>.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To design a canvas:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Access Canvas Designer by right-clicking a panel's green triangle (<img src="../Resources/Images/ONYX 77 OEP Administration Guide/Configuring Layout_1.png" style="width: 10px;height: 10px;" />) and selecting <b>Convert to Canvas</b>.</li>
            <li>Use Canvas Designer, <a href="#Add">add</a> or <a href="#Remove">remove</a> panels from the default canvas.</li>
            <li><a href="#Merge">Merge</a> one or more panels.</li>
            <li>Ensure that the canvas is designed as desired. After you enter TAB order mode, you cannot add, remove, or merge panels.</li>
            <li><a href="#Set">Set TAB order</a> for the canvas.</li>
            <li><a href="#Apply">Apply</a> the canvas to the page.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4><a name="Add"></a>Add panels</h4>
        <p>You can add any number of panels to a canvas. You can then <a href="#Merge">merge</a> panels to further enhance page design. </p>
        <p>Adding panels to a canvas resets all changes that you have made to the canvas. &#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To add panels to a canvas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click <img src="../Resources/Images/ONYX 77 OEP Administration Guide/Using Canvas Designer.jpg" /> to add a row of panels.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">OR</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click <img src="../Resources/Images/ONYX 77 OEP Administration Guide/Using Canvas Designer_1.jpg" /> to add a column of panels.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a name="Remove"></a>Remove panels</h4>
        <p>You can remove rows and columns of panels from a canvas. You cannot, however, remove a single panel from the middle of a row or column (instead, you can <a href="#Merge">merge</a> the panel with another panel). </p>
        <p>Removing panels from a canvas resets all changes that you have made to the canvas. &#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;page-break-before: always;">To remove panels from a canvas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click <img src="../Resources/Images/ONYX 77 OEP Administration Guide/Using Canvas Designer_2.jpg" /> to remove a row of panels.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">OR</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click <img src="../Resources/Images/ONYX 77 OEP Administration Guide/Using Canvas Designer_3.jpg" /> to remove a column of panels.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a name="Merge"></a>Merge panels</h4>
        <p>You can merge two or more panels to further enhance the design of your page. </p>
        <p>Refrain from merging panels until you have added or removed all necessary panels. Adding and removing panels resets all changes you have made to the canvas.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"> After a panel has been merged, that panel cannot be merged with another panel. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To merge panels:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the panels that you would like to merge. &#160;</li>
            <li>Click <img src="../Resources/Images/ONYX 77 OEP Administration Guide/Using Canvas Designer_4.jpg" /> to merge the selected panels. </li>
        </ol>
        <h4><a name="Set"></a>Set TAB order</h4>
        <p>A canvas's TAB order determines how OEP users navigate from one area of the page to another using their TAB key. A TAB order must be set for every canvas.</p>
        <p class="Tip" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Complete all canvas design before setting TAB order. After you enter panel tab order mode, you cannot change the design of the canvas. Your only option is to save the canvas.</p>
        <p>The default TAB order of a new canvas is from left to right for the first row, then left to right for the second row, and so on for each row defined in your canvas. TAB order begins with the number 0.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To set TAB order:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click   to switch to Panel Tab Order Mode.</li>
            <li>Select each panel in the order in which you want to set the TAB order. You cannot clear your selections, so set TAB order with care. TAB order cannot be modified without recreating the canvas.</li>
            <li><a href="#Apply">Apply</a> the canvas.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4><a name="Apply"></a>Apply the canvas</h4>
        <p>You must set the TAB order for a canvas before applying the canvas to the page.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To apply the canvas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click   <img src="../Resources/Images/ONYX 77 OEP Administration Guide/Setting Page level Properties_1.jpg" /> to apply your canvas to the page.</li>
        </ul>
