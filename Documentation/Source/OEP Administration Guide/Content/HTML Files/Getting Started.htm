        <h2><a name="top"></a>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>This book guides you through the main steps for modifying OEP to suit your business needs, deploying OEP to your users, and administering and maintaining OEP for your users.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Install the Onyx Demo Database</b>. Installing the demonstration database gives you insight into how OEP works and, because it provides sample data for all OEP features, enables you to explore all feature areas of OEP. </li>
            <li><b>Explore OEP</b>. It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with OEP and its many features before you begin to modify it.</li>
            <li><b>Plan your OEP implementation</b>. A well planned implementation is a successful implementation.</li>
            <li><b>Add domain data</b>. Add domain data to your OEP system.</li>
            <li><b>Configure your development environment</b>. Create a separate OEP profile for each set of OEP user interfaces that you plan to configure, and create user accounts for your UCW designers.</li>
            <li><b>Modify OEP</b>. Once you understand how your various groups can best use OEP, modify OEP to accommodate each group's unique needs and work flow.</li>
            <li><b>Test OEP</b>. Test OEP in your development and test environments to ensure that your modifications function as expected.</li>
            <li><b>Install OEP to your production environment</b>. When you're done modifying and testing OEP, install OEP to your production environment so you can begin the deployment process.</li>
            <li><b>Migrate your modifications</b>. After installing OEP to your production environment, migrate all desired changes from your development environment to your production environment. </li>
            <li><b>Configure users and user access</b>. Now that OEP is fully configured in your production environment, set up your users and set their access permissions.</li>
            <li><b>Set default user preferences</b>. Using a special user account called User Preferences Default, you can establish various preference settings for the OEP system.</li>
            <li><b>Deploy OEP</b>. You're now ready to deploy OEP to your users. </li>
            <li><b>Administer OEP</b>. OEP is up and running, and you're now responsible for administering and maintaining it for your users to ensure that their productivity remains high.</li>
        </ol>
