        <p class="Warning" MadCap:autonum=" &#160;&#160;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Do not use the literal identifier (forward slash for Standard mode and backslash for Postal mode) in front of another literal (non-mask) character.

        <h3 style="page-break-before: always;"><a name="Masked"></a>Masked Edit Control</h3>
        <p>The masked edit control&#160; that can be employed in client-side browser scripting applications. It is a visual control that behaves as a standard text input control, with the exception that the mask rules determine its behavior. The masking and formatting rules are applied as the user enters characters in the control, and the results are displayed interactively. When the user attempts to enter a character that is not allowed by the masking rules, the control refuses to accept the character and fires a ValidationError event.</p>
        <p>The mask rules can contain literal characters. These characters appear in the edit field, but the user cannot change them. The insertion point automatically skips these characters as the user enters text.</p>
