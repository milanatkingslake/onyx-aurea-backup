        <h2><a name="top"></a>What is OEP?</h2>
        <p>Onyx Employee Portal (OEP) is an enterprise-wide, Web-based software application that enables you to manage all of your customer information from a single user interface. </p>
        <p>OEP helps you manage every business interaction with your customers. Using OEP, you can gather, integrate, and share valuable customer information with all members of your organization. You typically enter customer records into OEP as leads or first-time customers, update them during the sales cycle, and maintain them throughout your organization's customer care programs. OEP is fully customizable and can be integrated with other systems. </p>
        <p>With this type of insight into integrated customer information, you can maximize both sales effectiveness and service responsiveness. OEP helps you manage activities such as marketing campaigns, sales opportunities, customer service, and technical support, thereby eliminating the problems caused by disparate departmental applications. </p>
