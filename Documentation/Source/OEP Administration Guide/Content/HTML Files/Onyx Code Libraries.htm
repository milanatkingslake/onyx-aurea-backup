        <h2>Onyx Code Libraries</h2>
        <p>The OEP folder tree contains a number of files that you can leverage for use in customizations. The more commonly used objects and functions are documented in the <a href="Programmer s Reference.htm#top">Programmer's Reference</a>. Other useful utility functions are stored in files that can be included in ASP pages when needed.</p>
        <h4>Programmer's Reference</h4>
        <p>The objects and functions described in the Programmer's Reference provide reusable and robust code that is used throughout the OEP application. By incorporating these items into your customizations, you can quicken your development rate and assure compatibility with future versions of OEP. The following table lists the features documented in the Programmer's Reference and the uses they provide. </p>
        <table>
            <thead>

        <h4>Common code</h4>
        <p>Many other common functions that are shared among the OEP feature set are available for use within your customizations. These functions are stored in a number of source files within the website folder tree. The functions can help with many of the more mundane tasks of generating HTML and configuring user actions within browser clients.</p>
        <h4>HTTP headers</h4>
        <p>Two files located in YourOEPwebsite\common\include folder contains code that sets the HTTP response headers to configure client and proxy caching. </p>

                        <p class="Table_Text">Sets response headers to prevent the ASP-generated data from being stored in the cache of the client browser or a proxy.

        <h4>Other functions</h4>
        <p>The following tables list some of the other useful functions and summarize their features. All folder paths are listed relative to the root path of the OEP virtual application. You can view the functions by parent file or by category. Review the code of each function to learn more about how they can be added to your custom code. </p>
