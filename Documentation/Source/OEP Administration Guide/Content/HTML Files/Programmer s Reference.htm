        <h1><a name="top"></a>Programmer's Reference</h1>
        <p>This book contains detailed information about the OEP COM components, VBScript classes, and application programming interfaces (APIs). Onyx provides numerous public interfaces so that you can customize and extend OEP functionality.</p>
        <p>The services provided are divided into the following categories:</p>
        <h4>Cached data</h4>
        <p>The <a href="Cached Data Functions.htm#top">Cached data functions</a> provide a means for maintaining application and session data.</p>
        <h4>Onyx utilities</h4>
        <p>The Onyx utilities library contains two commonly used functions that are part of the standard Win32 API. These functions have been added to a custom type library to make them easier to use from within OEP. </p>
        <h4>OTMHelper</h4>
        <p>The <a href="Using OTMHelper Classes.htm#top">OTMHelper classes</a> provide access to the OEAS Onyx Transaction Manager (OTM). The OTMHelper classes may be used within server-side ASP scripting, or with client-side DHTML.</p>
        <h4>Result list</h4>
        <p>There are three client-side JavaScript classes that are used to render some of the lists in OEP. &#160;</p>
        <h4>Security</h4>
        <p>The Security section describes the functions you call to restrict access to ASP pages, and the OEPSession object. </p>
