        <h3><a name="top"></a>Configure Users and User Access</h3>
        <p>After migrating all OEP modifications to your production environment and verifying that everything functions as expected, you're ready to add OEP users and configure their access permissions to OEP features.</p>
        <p>OES Security Administration enables you to create Onyx user accounts and define each user's access permissions. You may want to give certain users permission to access all OEP records and to be able to use all of OEP's functionality, and you may want to restrict other users' access permissions so that they'll be able to use only a limited set of OEP's records and functionality. For instance, you may not want users outside of your sales and finance groups to have access to records that reflect what customers pay for your products and services.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, you don't need to set each user's access permissions separately. Instead, you can use Security Administration to create roles that define a specific set of access permissions, and then assign users to these roles as appropriate. &#160;&#160;</p>
