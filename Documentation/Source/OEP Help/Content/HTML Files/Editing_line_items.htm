        <p class="BodyText">Product records can have one or more line items that provide additional 
 information about the product and its relationship with the customer. 
 Information about any line items associated with the products in your 
 system is available from your system administrator.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">When product line items are available in your 
 system, you can view a list of the line items for a product by clicking 
 the <b>Line Items</b> tab in the product 
 information window. You can edit an existing line item by clicking on 
 that item in the list, or you can create a new line item by clicking <img src="../Resources/Images/iconAdd0.gif" />. The product line information window opens and you can update 
 the information as needed. The information is saved along with the rest 
 of the product data when you click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconsave0.gif" /> to close the window. </p>
