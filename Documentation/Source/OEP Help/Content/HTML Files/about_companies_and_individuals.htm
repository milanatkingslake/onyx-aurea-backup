        <p class="BodyText">Almost all OEP data and processes are organized around customer records. 
 Customers in OEP fall into one of two categories: companies or individuals. 
 A company is an organization, and an individual is a person. Company and 
 individual records can be linked to one another to indicate relationships 
 of employment or corporate ownership.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Most actions in OEP begin with a company or individual in mind. Almost 
 all other OEP data records must be linked to a company or individual record 
 before they can exist within the system.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Most customer information is managed through the PowerPage. Click &#160;<img src="../Resources/Images/customeroff.gif" /> on the Navigation bar at any time to access the PowerPage. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">The PowerPage displays information about the customer, and it provides 
 links to edit the customer's demographic information. The customer information 
 that appears on the PowerPage is often referred to as the "active 
 customer record". Several OEP features that are described in this 
 documentation refer to the active customer record as the owner of their 
 data.</p>
