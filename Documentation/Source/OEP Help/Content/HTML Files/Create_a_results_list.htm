 Manager window with the criteria selection lists. You can expand and contract 
 the result list section by clicking <img src="../Resources/Images/iconarrowup0.gif" /> and <img src="../Resources/Images/iconarrowdown0.gif" />, 
 respectively. &#160;</p>

 heading. To reverse sort the list by the same field, click the column 
 heading a second time. </p>
