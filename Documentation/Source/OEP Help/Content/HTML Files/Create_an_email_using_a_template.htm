        <H2 class="Heading">Creating Emails Using Templates</H2>
        <p class="BodyText">OEP provides several different ways to add template text to an email 
 message. You can create a new email message from the Navigation bar by 
 clicking <b>Email Using a Template</b> 
 from within the <b>Add New</b> menu. 
 You can click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconemailtemplate0.gif" /> from any email list. You can also add template 
 text to any draft email by clicking <b>Insert 
 Template text</b> from the email information window. Each of these 
 actions causes the <b>Template Selection</b> 
 window to appear. </p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Template selection</p>
        <p class="BodyText">To select a template in the Template Selection window, navigate through 
 the folder hierarchy in the template list and click the name of the template 
 you want to use. Template groups are represented by the <img src="../Resources/Images/iconFolderSmall.gif" /><MadCap:keyword term="Email:Templates" /> icon. Click a group to expand it and view its contents. Click 
 the group a second time to hide its contents. Public shared templates 
 are represented by the <img src="../Resources/Images/icontemplatepublic0.gif" style="border-style: none;border: none;width: 13px;height: 14px;float: none;border-style: none;" width="13" height="14" border="0" /> icon. Templates that are only available 
 to you are represented by the <img src="../Resources/Images/iconProductSmall.gif" /> icon. Uncheck <b>Show 
 Public Templates</b> to view only those templates available to your 
 user account. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Some templates contain replaceable text fragments known as merge fields. 
 A merge field exists in the template text inside curly braces and with 
 a dollar sign before its name. For example, {$First Name} represents the 
 first name of a customer taken from their database record. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">If the template has merge fields in it, OEP may use the information 
 from the current record to populate the fields in the email. If this is 
 not the case, or you want to choose a different record, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconSearch0.gif" /> to open a search window. Enter criteria in the window and 
 click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconFind0.gif" /> to perform the search. A list of records that matches 
 the criteria appears in the bottom half of the search window. Click the 
 row of the record to use as a source for the data merge. If only one record 
 is found that matches the search criteria, OEP automatically closes the 
 search window and selects that record for the merge. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">To preview the email with the merged data, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconMergeTemplates0.gif" style="border-style: none;border: none;width: 23px;height: 22px;float: none;border-style: none;" width="23" height="22" border="0" />. A preview 
 window appears with the record data in the email. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">When you are ready to place the template text into the email, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconInsertTemplate0.gif" />. The text of the template is copied to the text editor of 
 the email window. The data for the merge fields is replaced when the text 
 is added to the email. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">If you cannot find the template you need, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconTemplateAdmin0.gif" /> to open 
 the Template Maintenance window. See <a href="Managing_templates.htm">Managing 
 templates</a> for more information about managing email templates. </p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Sending the email</p>
        <p class="BodyText">After the template text has been copied to the email window, you can 
 edit it as much as you like before sending the email. You can use also 
 use text from additional templates in a single email message. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">See <a href="Managing_Email_information.htm">Managing email information</a>
