        <p class="BodyText">Summary forecast and quote information appears in the <a href="Edit_an_Incident.htm">incident 
 information window</a>. Click the <b>Quotes</b> 
 tab to view the forecast and quotes associated with the current incident.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The Quotes tab is broken into three sections. The header section just 
 below the tab contains the <b>Action</b> 
 menu and a list where you can select the incident's forecast or any of 
 its saved quotes. The middle section lists the products that are attached 
 to the forecast or quote. The bottom section contains the total value 
 of all the items included in the forecast or quote, including any weighting 
 adjustments from a probability of sale calculation.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">From the list in the header, select the forecast or a quote to view 
 the product line items and the total value of the order. The items in 
 the product list normally appear in the order they were added to the forecast 
 or quote. To sort the product list by any of its columns, click the appropriate 
 column heading. To reverse sort the list by the same column, click the 
 column heading a second time.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Managing forecast and quote information</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Forecast and quote information is managed through a combination of windows 
 that are accessible from the header of the forecast and quote tab. For 
 more information about these windows, see <a href="Edit_Forecasts_and_Quotes.htm">Managing 
 forecast and quote information</a>.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Deleting a quote</p>
        <p class="BodyText">To delete a quote, select it by name from 
 the list in the header and select <b>Delete 
 Quote</b> from the <b>Action</b> menu.
