            <MadCap:keyword term="Comments" />Comments enable you to record additional customer information that you 
 may want to save outside the scope of an incident or task. You can enter 
 any type of information in a comment, such as a customer's opinion (“liked 
 the conference”) or judgment (“voted against the initiative”). &#160;Additionally, 
 a comment could include more personal customer information, such as a 
 customer's preference (“prefers to stay at the Hilton”) or their family 
 member's names. Any number of comments can be associated with a customer.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">To view the comment information for the active customer, select the 
 <b>Comments</b> tab on the bottom half 
 of the <a href="Access_the_Companies_or_Individuals_PowerPage.htm">PowerPage</a>. 
 The list of comments for the active customer record appears in the bottom 
 half of the Data Area frame.</p>
