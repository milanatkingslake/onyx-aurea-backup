        <H2 class="Heading">Managing Templates</H2>
        <p class="BodyText">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Email:Templates" />Templates are managed from the Template Maintenance window. From this 
 window you can view information about the templates in the system that 
 are available to you. You can also modify existing templates and create 
 new ones. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Templates are arranged in the Template List in groups. Groups are represented 
 by the <img src="../Resources/Images/iconFolderSmall.gif" /> icon. Click a group to expand it and view its contents. 
 Click the group a second time to hide its contents. Public shared templates 
 are represented by the <img src="../Resources/Images/icontemplatepublic0.gif" style="border-style: none;border: none;width: 13px;height: 14px;float: none;border-style: none;" width="13" height="14" border="0" /> icon. Templates that are only available 
 to you are represented by the <img src="../Resources/Images/iconProductSmall.gif" /> icon. Click a template in 
 the list to review its contents and description. </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">To delete a template, select it in the Template List and click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconDelete0.gif" />. &#160;</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">To add a template, select a group in the hierarchy where the template 
 will appear. Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconAdd0.gif" /> to add a blank template to the group. 
 Give the template a name and a description. To share the template with 
 other OEP users, check <b>Save as Public 
 Template</b>. If left unchecked, the template will only be visible 
 to your user account. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Inserting data fields</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Data can be automatically retrieved from the OEP database and added 
 to emails before they are sent. To add data fields to a template, use 
 the three drop down lists in the center of the Template Maintenance window. 
 Start with Merge Data Type to select a data type source. Next select an 
 item from the Merge Data From list. The items in this list are created 
 by your system administrator and they identify different searches that 
 can be performed on the data in your database. Finally, select one or 
 more data fields to add to the text from the Insert Merge Fields list. 
 This list contains the data items that can be inserted into the template 
 text. The field is inserted at the position of the cursor.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">You can add as many fields as you like in as many different places as 
 you like. The fields are replaced with text from a database record when 
 the template selection window is closed. </p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Formatting the text</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Type text into the template as needed. Use the formatting icons to change 
 the text size, font, weight, color, justification, or to add bullets and 
 numbering. You can also use the spelling checker to fix any potential 
 spelling issues. The editor section of the window is identical to that 
 used to compose regular emails.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Saving a template</p>
        <p class="BodyText">When you are ready to save the template, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconsave0.gif" />. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">If you want to save an existing template under a different name (for 
 example, to make a copy), click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconsaveas2.gif" />. The <b>Save 
 Template As</b> dialog appears. Give the template a new name and select 
 a folder where the template can be accessed. To share the template with 
 other OEP users, check <b>Save as Public 
 Template</b>. Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconsave0.gif" /> when you have made your changes.
