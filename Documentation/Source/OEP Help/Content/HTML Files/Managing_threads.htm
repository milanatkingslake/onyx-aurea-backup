        <p class="BodyText">OEP stores thread information for each email in the database. By clicking 
 the <b><MadCap:keyword term="Email:Threads" />Threads</b> tab, you can view 
 the other emails that share the same thread as the current one. Emails 
 are automatically assigned to threads when created, but you can manually 
 attach emails to different threads if necessary. An email can be assigned 
 to only one thread at a time. </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">To open an email in the current thread, click a row in the list. A new 
 email information window appears. </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">To start a new thread for this email, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconBrokenLink0.gif" />. The email 
 is assigned a new thread with a new unique identifier. </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">To assign the email to a different thread, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconCreateLink0.gif" />. A search 
 window appears with criteria for emails. Enter criteria and click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconFind0.gif" /> to perform the search. Click an email in the results list 
 to add the current email to the target email's thread. </li>
