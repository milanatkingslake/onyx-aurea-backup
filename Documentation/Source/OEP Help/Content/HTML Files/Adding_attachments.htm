        <p class="BodyText">There are three types of files that you can attach to an email message: 
 you can add a file from your computer, you can add a literature item, 
 or you can add any file that has been attached to an OEP record.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Attachments" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Email:Attachments" />Adding attachments to an unsent email</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Click the <b>Attach</b> button (located 
 just below the recipient information) to open the Attachments dialog. 
 &#160;</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Click the <b>New File</b> tab to attach 
 a file located on your local hard disk. Click Browse to open the <b>Choose file</b> dialog. Navigate to the 
 location of the file and click Open. The path to the file appears in the 
 <b>File</b> box. Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconAdd0.gif" /> to 
 add the file to the Files To Add box. Repeat if necessary. </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Click the <b>Literature Item</b> tab 
 to view the hierarchy for literature items. Navigate through the tree 
 and click an item to add. The <img src="../Resources/Images/iconFolderSmall.gif" /> icons represent groups and 
 the <img src="../Resources/Images/iconProductSmall.gif" /> icons represent literature products. Click a literature 
 product to select it and then click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconAdd0.gif" /> to add its file to 
 the Files To Add box. </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Click the <b>Existing OEP Attachment</b> 
 tab to attach files that are attached to the current record, or to search 
 the database for other records that have attachments. To use attachments 
 from other database records, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconSearch0.gif" /> to open a search window. 
 Select a record type and enter search criteria. Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconFind0.gif" /> to 
 perform the search. Click a record from the results list. The search window 
 closes and all files attached to that record appear in a list. Check the 
 box of each attachment to add to the email and then click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconAdd0.gif" />. The selected files appear by name in the Files To Add box. 
 </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyTextIndent_2">When you are finished selecting attachments, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconconfirm0.gif" />. 
 The Attachments window closes and the files appear by name in the Attach 
 line of the email. </p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Viewing attachments from a draft or received email</p>
        <p class="BodyText">To open or save an attachment that is part of a draft or received email, 
 double-click the name of the file in the Attach line in the email window. 
 The attachment file is downloaded through the browser. Graphic files that 
 a browser recognizes (such as .JPG or .GIF files) will appear in a new 
 browser window. If necessary, follow the on-screen instructions for saving 
 the file to your computer. </p>
        <p class="Warning" MadCap:autonum=" &#160;&#160;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"> If you have problems viewing an attachment file directly from 
 OEP, try saving the file before attempting to open it. </p>
