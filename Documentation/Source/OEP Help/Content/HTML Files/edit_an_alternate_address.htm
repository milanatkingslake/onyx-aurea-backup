        <p class="BodyText">While each customer has a primary address for contact purposes, customers 
 can have more than one address. These addresses can be used for any purpose.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">You can create and manage alternate customer addresses through the <b>Other Addresses</b> window. To view all 
 of the addresses for a customer, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconaddress0.gif" /> below the primary 
 address in the edit window (Note: this button is not visible until the 
 customer has been saved).</p>
        <p class="BodyText">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Customers:Address information" />The customer's address information appears in a table at the top of 
 the Other Addresses window. A checked box in the <b>Primary</b> 
 column indicates the customer's primary address. &#160;Any 
 other listed addresses are alternate addresses. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Below the table, in the <b>Address Detail</b> 
 pane, is the <b>Type</b> list that contains 
 the complete list of address types. To edit or add an alternate address, 
 select a type from the list and the address information appears in the 
 text boxes in the bottom half of the window.</p>
        <p class="BodyText"><a href="../Validating Addresses.htm">Validate the address</a> by clicking <img src="../Resources/Images/Add_validate.png" />. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Update the information as needed and click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconsave0.gif" /> to save the 
 address data.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">To remove an address type from the list, select the address type and 
 click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconDelete0.gif" />. The address information for that type disappears 
 from the list and is no longer associated with the customer.</p>
        <p class="Note_1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The address that is marked as primary cannot 
 be edited or deleted from the Other Addresses window. Use the customer 
 edit window to change the primary address. </p>
