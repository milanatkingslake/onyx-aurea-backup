        <H2 class="Heading">Selecting Search Criteria</H2>
        <p class="BodyText">List Manager searches are based on views of different database portions. 
 Common views include Companies and Individuals. Select the appropriate 
 view from the drop down list and the search criteria that can be used 
 for that view appears in the window. The List Manager window features 
 the available criteria from the view on the left side of the window and 
 the selected criteria for the search on the right side.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Criteria selection</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The selected criteria list is divisible in up to three blocks. The contents 
 of a block are combined when the search executes. Each block is then used 
 as a separate test against the contents of the database. By dividing criteria 
 in separate blocks you can broaden the scope of the search. Individual 
 criteria lines in the blocks can be included or excluded in the search 
 as needed by checking the box adjacent to each line. To select or deselect 
 all criteria, check the box at the top of the list.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Within the available criteria list, the <img src="../Resources/Images/iconFolderSmall.gif" style="border: none;float: none;width: 12px;height: 10px;border-style: none;border-style: none;" width="12" height="10" border="0" /> icons represent 
 data categories. Click a category to view its available data items and 
 subcategories. Each item is represented by the <img src="../Resources/Images/iconProductSmall.gif" style="width: 10px;height: 11px;margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px;margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;border-style: none;border-style: none;" width="10" height="11" border="0" /> icon. Click 
 a data item to add it to the selected criteria list.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">When you click a data item, the Input Criteria dialog box appears. From 
 here you can specify a value for the data item. Depending on the type 
 of data, there are two different ways to specify criteria. Some items 
 allow you to select an operator (for example, less than, greater than, 
 equal to, etc.) and type a data value. Other items provide a list of predetermined 
 values from which you can select one or more to include or exclude from 
 the results set. After you specify a value, select a block in which to 
 place the criteria and click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconsave0.gif" /> to close the dialog box.</p>
        <p class="Note_1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Selecting at least one criterion per block that is based 
 on an indexed data field may improve the performance of the search. Indexed 
 fields are marked by the <img src="../Resources/Images/key.gif" style="margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px;margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;width: 11px;height: 10px;float: none;border-style: none;border-style: none;" width="11" height="10" border="0" /> icon.&#160;</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Advanced users who want to customize the SQL query string that is used 
 for the search can click the <img src="../Resources/Images/iconsql0.gif" /> button. The string appears 
 in place of the selected criteria rows. If you make changes to the SQL 
 string you cannot return to the list view. Otherwise, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconcriteria0.gif" /> to hide the SQL string and view the original rows of selected 
 criteria.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Advanced users who want to view the SQL query string that is used for 
 the search can click the <img src="../Resources/Images/iconsql0.gif" /> button. The string appears in 
 place of the selected criteria rows. You cannot edit the SQL string. Click 
 <img src="../Resources/Images/iconcriteria0.gif" /> to hide the SQL string and view the original rows of 
 selected criteria.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">
            <MadCap:keyword term="List Manager:Searching" />Searching by date</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The List Manager date search begins at midnight of the date entered. 
 When you search for records by date using the less-than-or-equal-to operator 
 (&lt;=), always include a specific time period in your search query. Otherwise 
 the List Manager search finds no matches, and returns the records for 
 the <i>previous</i> day to the date 
 entered instead. Entering a time period ensures all the records you want 
 are included.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Other options</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Check the <b>Ignore Duplicates</b> 
 box to prevent the search from returning multiple instances of the same 
 record in the results list.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconnew0.gif" /> to reset the entire List Manager window. Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconerase0.gif" /> to clear out lines from the selected criteria list. Only 
 lines with checked boxes will be cleared when you click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconerase0.gif" />. Unchecked lines remain in the list.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconcount0.gif" /> to get a count of the number of records that 
 will be returned when the search is executed. By using this button you 
 can get a preliminary idea of the scope of your search before running 
 it.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Executing the search</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconFind0.gif" /> to execute the search 
 and generate a <a href="Create_a_results_list.htm">results list</a>. </p>
