        <p class="BodyText">Work tickets can be linked to customer records to aid in the tracking 
 of customer issues. To view the list of work tickets linked to the active 
 customer, click <b>Work Tickets</b> in 
 the <b>Customers</b> submenu of the Navigation 
 Bar. The list of linked work tickets appears in the Data Area frame. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">The list includes those work tickets that are linked to this customer 
 both directly and through an incident. All work tickets that are linked 
 to the incidents assigned to the customer appear in this list. The Link 
 Type column identifies how the work ticket is linked to the customer. 
 </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Click a row in the list to view the complete information for the work 
 ticket record. The editable data appears in a separate window. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">You can click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconrefresh0.gif" /> at any time to refresh the list of linked 
 work tickets.</p>
        <p class="TaskHeading">To create a new work ticket that will be linked to the customer 
 record:</p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconAdd0.gif" />. A blank work ticket edit 
 form appears in a new window. See <a href="Adding_and_editing_Work_Tickets.htm">Adding 
 and editing work tickets</a> for more information on creating a work ticket. 
 Once you save the work ticket, it is automatically linked to the customer.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="TaskHeading">To link an existing work ticket to the customer record:</p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li class="ListBullet_1">&#160;Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconCreateLink0.gif" />. A search form appears. </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Enter criteria in the fields and click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconFind0.gif" />. The results of the search appear below the search criteria. 
 Each record in the list has a check box next to the work ticket ID. </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Check the box for each work ticket to be linked 
 to the customer. </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconsave0.gif" /> to save your changes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="TaskHeading">To remove the link between a customer record and a work ticket:</p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Check the box next to the work ticket ID for each 
 work ticket to unlink. </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconBrokenLink0.gif" />. The work tickets are unlinked 
 from the customer record.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Note_1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Only work tickets that are linked to the customer record 
 directly can be unlinked in this manner. A work ticket that is linked 
 to a customer through an incident cannot be unlinked from this screen. 
 Edit the incident to unlink the work ticket.</p>
        <p class="TaskHeading">To delete one or more linked work tickets from the system:</p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Check the box next to the work ticket ID for each 
 work ticket to delete. </li>
