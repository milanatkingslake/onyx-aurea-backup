        <p class="BodyText">A contact can be an employee or a representative of a company (internal 
 contact), or a company or individual (external contact) who has a specific 
 or functional relationship with a customer. Contacts can be used for companies 
 and individuals, as well as for incidents, tasks, products, and work tickets.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The Contacts feature enables relationships to be captured that are not 
 direct relationships in the hierarchy of a company's structure, but rather 
 ancillary relationships that exist in business. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">
            <MadCap:keyword term="External contacts" />A primary contact is an external contact who has been identified as 
 the preferred contact. Many records can have multiple external contacts. 
 However, the primary contact is the one that should be communicated with 
 initially.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Contact information is available in many different places throughout 
 OEP. Click a topic below to learn more about using contacts within a specific 
 OEP feature.</p>
