            <MadCap:keyword term="Scripts" />All scripts that are assigned to a customer or incident appear under 
 the <b>Scripts</b> tab. The list 
 identifies scripts by name and includes information about their state 
 (in progress and completed, for example). To open the script delivery 
 window for an existing script, click a row in the list. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">For more information on viewing and sorting the records within the list 
 of scripts, see <a href="Using_lists.htm">Using results lists</a>. </p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Adding scripts</p>
        <p class="BodyText">To add a script, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconAdd0.gif" /> to open the script chooser window. 
 Scripts in this window are arranged in groups in a tree structure. The 
 scripts that are available vary depending on the type of owner record 
 (customer or incident). Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconscriptgroup.gif" /> to expand a group and view 
 its contents. Click the group a second time to hide the contents. Click 
 a script to view information about it in the bottom of the window. When 
 you have located the appropriate script, click <b>Start</b> 
 (or double-click the script) to open the script delivery window. </p>

 information about entering the data necessary to complete a script.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Deleting scripts</p>
        <p class="BodyText">To delete one or more scripts, check the box
