        <p class="BodyText">All OEP users who have permission to use OEP-Offline can subscribe to 
 items for themselves. Additionally, your system administrator can designate 
 certain OEP end-users as advanced subscribers. Advanced subscribers are 
 OEP users with permissions to use OEP-Offline, and who have also been 
 authorized to subscribe to items on behalf of other users using <a href="Using_advanced_subscription.htm">Advanced 
 Subscription</a>. This is useful in scenarios when you want to allow a 
 single individual to designate other users to have access to specific 
 data in OEP-Offline.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">In addition to being able to subscribe to items for others, advanced 
 subscribers also have access to additional functionality in <a href="Using_subscription_review.htm">Subscription 
 Review</a>. &#160;Subscription 
 Review allows subscribers to review all of the items to which they have 
 subscribed, and also enables advanced subscribers to review the items 
 to which other OEP-Offline users have subscribed.</p>
        <p class="Note_1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Only those users who are designated Advanced Subscribers 
 can subscribe items on the behalf of other OEP-Offline users.</p>
