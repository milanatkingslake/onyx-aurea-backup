        <p class="BodyText">The <b>Search Criteria</b> and the <b>Search Results</b> windows may include fields that are hierarchical, meaning that the values in those fields depend upon values entered in preceding fields.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">For example, because the values for the field State depend on the value for the field Country, Country is the parent field for the dependent field State. This hierarchy can exist at several levels; therefore, a field can be both a parent field as well as a dependent field.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">For example, in a hierarchy of Resolution Code 1 - Resolution Code 2 - Resolution Code 3, the field Resolution Code 2 is a parent for the field Resolution Code 3, but a dependent for the field Resolution Code 1.</p>
        <p class="Note_1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Hierarchical relationships are applicable only to fields where you select an item from a drop-down list.</p>
        <p class="Note_1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">You can move a parent field from one column to anyone of the other two columns among Selected, Available, and Disabled columns. When you move a parent field, the associated child fields move along with the parent field, but you cannot move a child field alone. </p>
