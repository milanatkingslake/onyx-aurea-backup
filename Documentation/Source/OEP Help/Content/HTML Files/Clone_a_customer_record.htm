        <p class="BodyText">Customers can be cloned to create new, nearly identical customers. This 
 feature is most often used to create associated customers without having 
 to spend the time copying important data from one customer to another.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The new customer does not have to be the same type as the source customer. 
 You can clone an individual to create company and clone a company to create 
 an individual. If you do clone a customer to another customer type, you 
 have the option to link the individual record to the company record automatically.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Click <img src="../Resources/Images/btnClone0.gif" /> at the top of the power page to clone the current 
 customer record. A dialog box appears asking if you want to clone the 
 customer to a company or individual record. If the new record is not the 
 same type as the source record, check <b>Create 
 Links</b> to link the individual record to the company record.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Click <b>OK 
 </b>to open the edit customer window. The fields in the window are 
 automatically populated with the information from the source record. Complete 
 or correct the information as necessary and click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconsave0.gif" /> to save 
 the new record. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Only the data that has been saved to the database 
 is copied from the source customer record to the cloned customer. Save 
 any changes to the source record before clicking the clone button.</p>
