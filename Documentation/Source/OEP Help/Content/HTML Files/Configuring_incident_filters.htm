            <MadCap:keyword term="Home page" />Navigator bookmarks are listed in the Incidents, Tasks, and 
 Work Tickets sections of the Home Page. Create any filters that you plan 
 to use for your Home Page before configuring these sections. When a filter 
 specifies criteria for multiple items, such as sales incidents and tasks, 
 that filter is available for both the Incidents section and the Tasks 
 section of the Home Page. In such cases, each section lists only the filter 
 results of its respective type.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Each filter result that the Home Page displays consists of the first 
 ten items that meet the filter's search criteria, ordered according to 
 the filter's sort criteria. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconhpsectionprefs0.gif" style="border-style: none;border: none;width: 23px;height: 22px;float: none;border-style: none;" width="23" height="22" border="0" />to specify the layout of each Incidents, Tasks, 
 and Work Tickets section. The list on the right contains available filters 
 that do not appear on the Home Page, and the list on the left contains 
 selected filters that do appear. Click <b>&gt;&gt;</b> 
 and <b>&lt;&lt;</b> to move highlighted 
 filters between the lists. </p>
        <p class="BodyText"><b>Move Up</b> and <b>Move 
 Down</b> positions the selected filter results within the section, 
 which are positioned two abreast. The results of the filter listed first 
 in the Selected Views list appear in the top left corner of the section, 
 and the results of the filter listed second appear in the top right corner. 
 The results of the filter listed third appear on the left side under the 
 first filter results, and so on.</p>
