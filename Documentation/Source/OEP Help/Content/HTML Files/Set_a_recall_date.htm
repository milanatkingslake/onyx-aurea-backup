        <p class="BodyText">The following features are also available when working with incident 
 records. All are available from the incident information window.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Attach the incident to a message or an email</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconemail0.gif" /> to open a message window with the incident as 
 an attachment. See <a href="Send_a_message.htm">Sending messages</a> for 
 more information on using Messenger.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconemailenvelope0.gif" /> to open an email window with the incident information

        <p class="ElementHeader">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Incidents:Work time" />Tracking work time</p>
        <p class="BodyText">OEP incidents provide a feature that records the amount of time you 
 spend working on an incident record. By correctly recording this information 
 you can measure the time spent on managing incident records.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The timer normally runs from the instant you open the incident to the 
 time that you close the window. To pause the timer, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconpause0.gif" />. To restart the timer, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconplay0.gif" />. You can manually 
 adjust the time by typing a value (positive or negative) into the <b>Time Adjustment</b> box. The time value 
 is recalculated when the incident is saved.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Audit log" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Incidents:Audit log" />Reviewing the audit log</p>
        <p class="BodyText">One of the tabs in the incident information window is for the incident's 
 audit log. Each time an OEP user saves changes to an incident record, 
 a small amount of summary information about the incident is written to 
 the log. You can review the log to see which users updated the incident 
 and when.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Using recall dates</p>
        <p class="BodyText">You can set a recall date on an incident if you want to review it at 
 a specific date and time. The recall can be attached to a reminder so 
 that it alerts you automatically<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Obsolete">, or the date can be used as part of a 
 <a href="About_Task_Manager.htm">Task Manager</a> search</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">To set a recall date for an incident, check <b>Recall</b> 
 in the incident information window. Type information in the <b>Date</b> 
 and <b>Time</b> boxes. To set the recall 
 to alert the assigned user with a dialog box, check <b>Remind 
 Assigned User</b>.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">If you select the <b>Send to Calendar</b> check box, a reminder is created in your Outlook calendar on the specified recall date.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Recall settings can be pre-configured by incident 
 type in your <a href="About_User_Preferences.htm">OEP preferences</a>. 
 </p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Viewing incident history information</p>
        <p class="BodyText">To view the history information for the active incident, select the 
 <b>History</b> tab on the bottom half 
 of the incident information window. &#160;The 
 History screen in the Data Area frame lists the most recently updated 
 records that are associated with the active incident record. History lists 
 appear on both the <a href="Access_the_Companies_or_Individuals_PowerPage.htm">PowerPage</a> 
 and the incident information window.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The incident history list provides a chronological record of past events 
 for all notes, contacts, tasks, quotes, work tickets, and attachments 
 that are associated with an incident record. To view a record included 
 in an incident's history, click a row in the history list. The record's 
 edit window appears. Use this window to view or update information for 
 that record. Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconsave0.gif" /> to save your changes.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Watching an Incident</p>
        <p class="BodyText">You can watch a record by clicking <img src="../Resources/Images/watch.png" />. Click <img src="../Resources/Images/Unwatch.png" /> to unwatch a record. When a watch is set on an incident, the administrator gets an e-mail notification when the incident is modified.</p>
