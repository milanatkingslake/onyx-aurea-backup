        <H2 class="Heading">Selecting Search Criteria</H2>
        <p class="BodyText">You can select <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Obsolete">Task Manager </MadCap:conditionalText>search criteria either manually on a case-by-case 
 basis or by loading an existing filter with pre-defined criteria. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">You can reveal and hide the search criteria pane by clicking<img src="../Resources/Images/iconarrowup0.gif" style="border-style: none;margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px;margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;width: 23px;height: 22px;float: none;border-style: none;" width="23" height="22" border="0" />and <img src="../Resources/Images/iconarrowdown0.gif" style="border-style: none;border: none;width: 23px;height: 22px;float: none;border-style: none;" width="23" height="22" border="0" />, respectively. Hiding the search criteria 
 pane creates more space for viewing the <a href="Access_Tasks_or_Incidents_from_a_results_list.htm">results 
 list</a>. The search criteria pane contains tabs that when clicked, reveal 
 options specific to the tab. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconerase0.gif" style="border-style: none;margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px;margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;float: none;width: 23px;height: 22px;border-style: none;" width="23" height="22" border="0" /> to clear the criteria from all tabs. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconFind0.gif" style="border-style: none;border: none;width: 23px;height: 22px;float: none;border-style: none;" width="23" height="22" border="0" /> to search using the selected criteria.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">The tabs</p>
        <p class="BodyText">To search<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Obsolete"> using Task Manager</MadCap:conditionalText>, you must select at least one record type 
 to be returned in the results list. You can select the record type by 
 clicking the check box on the tab for the desired record type. You can 
 select either a single record type for your search or any combination 
 of record types. </p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Common tab</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The <b>Common </b>tab contains items 
 that are applicable to all of the items to be considered for the search. 
 This tab contains options for keywords and date ranges. You can also indicate 
 whether you would like the search to return records where the selected 
 users are contacts for the record.</p>
        <p class="BodyTextIndent_2"><b>Keyword:</b> 
 To use keywords in the search, type them into the <b>Keyword</b> 
 box. Separate multiple keywords with semi-colons.</p>
        <p class="BodyTextIndent_2"><b>Filter 
 By Date:</b> When selecting a date range, you can search on the insert 
 date, update date, or recall date of the records. </p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li class="ListBullet_2">
                <MadCap:keyword term="Task Manager:Searching" />If you are searching 
 by <b>Actual Dates</b>, type the full 
 date into the text boxes. To specify a single day, type the same date 
 into both boxes.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_2">If you are searching 
 by <b>Relative Dates</b> for <b>Insert</b> 
 or <b>Update</b>, set the search date 
 range by selecting the number of days, weeks, or months before the current 
 date as your starting date, and by selecting the number of days, weeks, 
 or months before the current date as your ending date. For instance, if 
 you want to search for records inserted in the previous 5 days, you would 
 enter a <b>Starting</b> value of 6 and 
 select <b>Day(s) Before</b>, and you 
 would enter an Ending value of 1 and select <b>Day(s) 
 Before</b>.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_2">If you are searching 
 by <b>Relative Dates</b> for <b>Recall</b>, 
 the same logic applies as for <b>Insert</b> 
 and <b>Update</b>, except that you can 
 additionally set the search date range by selecting the number of days, 
 weeks, or months after the current date as your starting date and ending 
 date.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyTextIndent_2"><b>Include records where 
 selected users are contacts</b>: This check 
 box changes the way in which the names selected in the user tree are interpreted. 
 <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Obsolete">By default, Task Manager only retrieves the records that are assigned 
 to the selected user names. When this box is checked, Task Manager also 
 retrieves the items that have the selected user names listed as contacts.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Record type tabs</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The remaining tabs represent specific record types including sales opportunities, 
 service requests, support incidents, tasks (including sales, service, 
 and support tasks), work tickets, scripts, and emails. Clicking one of 
 these tabs reveals criteria specific to that record type. Each tab also 
 has a check box that includes the record type in the search. If the box 
 is not selected, the criteria for the tab is ignored and the record type 
 is not retrieved as part of the search. An asterisk (*) appears next to 
 the tab name when there are criteria specified for the tab.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Search criteria for each tab are provided in list boxes that represent 
 data values for the specific record type of the tab (for example, Type, 
 Status, and Priority). You can select one or more criteria from each list 
 box. Use the CTRL key when clicking to select multiple items in a list.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Criteria in the user tree and common tab is not applied to searches 
 for email records. The email tab has its own fields for user links and 
 date information. Date criteria for emails can be selected by clicking 
 dates on a calendar. Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconopenwindow0.gif" style="border-style: none;border: none;width: 20px;height: 19px;float: none;border-style: none;" width="20" height="19" border="0" /> to view the calendar. Today's 
 date is highlighted. To move between months, click the arrow keys in the 
 top corners of the calendar. Click a date in the calendar to select it.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">The user tree</p>
        <p class="BodyText">You can hide and reveal the user tree by clicking<img src="../Resources/Images/iconpaneleft0.gif" style="border-style: none;border: none;width: 23px;height: 22px;float: none;border-style: none;" width="23" height="22" border="0" />and <img src="../Resources/Images/iconpaneright0.gif" style="border-style: none;border: none;width: 23px;height: 22px;float: none;border-style: none;" width="23" height="22" border="0" />, respectively.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">To identify the users who will be part of the search criteria, select 
 one or more of them from the tree by clicking their names. Users are listed 
 in the tree under group hierarchies. Groups are represented with the <img src="../Resources/Images/imgGroup.gif" style="border-style: none;border: none;width: 17px;height: 13px;float: none;border-style: none;" width="17" height="13" border="0" /> icon, and individual users are represented by the <img src="../Resources/Images/imgUser.gif" style="border-style: none;border: none;width: 17px;height: 13px;float: none;border-style: none;" width="17" height="13" border="0" /> icon. Click a group name to include all of its members in 
 the search, or click the names of individual users to include them in 
 the search. A semi-colon delimited list of the selected user names appears 
 in the box above the tree. To deselect a user or group from the search, 
 click the user or group name again. The <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Obsolete">Task Manager </MadCap:conditionalText>search retrieves 
 those records that meet the search criteria and which are assigned to 
 the users you select from the user tree. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">You can also type user names directly into the <b>Select 
 Users</b> box. Press CTRL-K <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Obsolete">(or move the focus to a different part 
 of Task Manager)</MadCap:conditionalText> to verify the names you entered. A dialog box appears 
 if there are any unresolved names in the box. See <a href="User_selection.htm">About 
 OEP user selection</a> for more information on locating users by name.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Using filters</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Commonly used searches can be saved in filters<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Obsolete">, thereby saving the time 
 of having to create them each time you use Task Manager</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Obsolete">. The saved filters 
 appear in a drop down list at the top of the Task Manager pane</MadCap:conditionalText>. Click 
 the name of a filter in the list, and its criteria is automatically applied 
 to the tabs and the user tree.</p>
        <p class="BodyText" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Obsolete">Task Manager can be configured to load a default filter each time it 
 opens. If no default filter exists, Task Manager reloads the last filter 
 used for a search, while you remain logged in to the system; once you 
 log out, the last filter used is forgotten.</p>
