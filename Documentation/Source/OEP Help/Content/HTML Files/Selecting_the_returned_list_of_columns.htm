        <H2 class="Heading">Selecting Returned List of Columns</H2>
        <p class="BodyText">You can select and arrange the data that your search returns. The views 
 for a search, which are commonly Companies or Individuals, consists of 
 columns of data about each record that meets the search criteria. These 
 views have a default list of columns that you can modify to suit your 
 needs.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Result lists:Configuring" />Before configuring the column list, select the view from the list box 
 in the upper left corner of the List Manger window. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconcolumndefinition0.gif" /> on the List Manager window to display the <b>Result Set Column Definition</b> dialog 
 box. This dialog box displays on the left a list of all column names from 
 which to choose, and on the right, the columns that are currently selected. 
 For new searches the default list of columns appears on the right. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconFolderSmall.gif" /> to view the columns available for each data category. 
 The currently selected column names are bold. Click a column name to include 
 it in the currently selected list. To remove a column, select it from 
 the current list and click <b>Remove</b>. 
 Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconerase0.gif" /> to remove all columns, except the required columns, 
 from the selected list. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Selecting a column from the current list and clicking <b>Move 
 Up</b> or <b>Move Down</b> positions 
 the column in the results list.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconsave0.gif" /> to close the <b>Result 
 Set Column Definition</b> dialog box. Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconsave0.gif" /> on the List 
 Manager window to save changes to the column list and the search select 
 statements.</p>
        <p class="Warning" MadCap:autonum=" &#160;&#160;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Customizing the columns returned in the result set can 
 influence the results returned by the List Manager search. This can occur 
 when you add a child object column to the result set. For example, if 
 you create a search that returns a list of companies (parent objects), 
 but then customize the returned list of columns for the search to return 
 an incident (child object) column, companies that do not have a child 
 incident object will not be returned by your search.</p>
