        <H4 class="Heading">Configuring Result Lists</H4>
        <p class="BodyText">Most lists in OEP can be configured to display their information in 
 a format that best suits your needs. Depending on the list, you may be 
 able to change which data columns appear in the list, each column's position 
 in the list, the maximum number of records the list returns, and the default 
 sort order of the records. Some configuration can be done directly to 
 the list itself, but other tasks are only possible using the List Configuration 
 Dialog (LCD). </p>
        <p class="BodyText">To learn more about working with records in a list, see <a href="Using_lists.htm">Using 
 result lists</a>.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">To view the LCD from a list in OEP, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconDisplayLCD0.gif" /> in the lower right 
 corner of the list. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">To save your changes directly from the list or within the LCD, click 
 <img src="../Resources/Images/iconsave0.gif" />. The entire state of the list will be saved. This saves 
 all configuration items located on the LCD, and includes the current column 
 widths and the view state (multiple pages vs all records visible at once).</p>
        <p class="BodyText">To discard any unsaved changes to a list and return to the saved settings, 
 click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconresetlayout0.gif" />. This button is visible in the lower right corner 
 of a list and appears in the LCD. Only available within the LCD is another 
 button that you can use to return the list to the system default settings. 
 Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconresetlayouttosystem0.gif" /> to discard all modified changes and view the list 
 as it is configured by your system administrator. </p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Result lists:Configuring" />Configuring data columns</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Data columns in a list have several configurable properties. A column's 
 width and position in a list can be changed. Columns can even be removed 
 from lists entirely. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">To change the width of a column, grab the vertical border in the column 
 heading with the mouse and move it to the left or right. Release the mouse 
 button when the column reaches the desired width. Some column widths will 
 have size limits set for them. If you exceed a limit, the column will 
 only size to the limit after you release the mouse button. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">You can change the order of columns from a list or from the LCD. To 
 change the order of the columns directly from the list, place the mouse 
 pointer over a column heading and click and hold the mouse button. Drag 
 the column over another column heading in the list. Release the mouse 
 button and the dragged column moves to the right of the target column. 
 You can also drag columns to and from the detail area of a list. To move 
 a column in or out of the detail area, the area must be visible. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">With the LCD you can change the order of data columns and even add and 
 remove columns in the list. There are two list boxes in the LCD that contain 
 the names of data columns. The first, Available Fields, contains the data 
 items that are retrieved as part of the list search but do not appear 
 in the list. The second list box, Selected Fields, contains the data items 
 that do appear in the list. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">To move data columns from the Available Fields to the Selected Fields, 
 click the name of a one or more columns to select them and click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconmoveright0.gif" />. To move data columns from the Selected Fields to the Available 
 Fields, click the name of one or more columns to select them and click 
 <img src="../Resources/Images/iconmoveleft0.gif" />. &#160;</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Data columns in the Selected Fields list box appear in the same order 
 as they appear in the list. The further down a column appears in the Selected 
 Fields list box, the further to the right it appears in the list. To move 
 a column, select it and click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconMoveDown0.gif" /> to move it down or <img src="../Resources/Images/iconMoveUp0.gif" /> to move it up. The bottom half of the Selected Fields list 
 box contains the data columns that appear in the detail area of the list. 
 These fields appear under the label DETAIL. To move a column from the 
 header row to the detail area (or vice versa), select it and click the 
 appropriate button until the column moves to the desired position.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">If a data column has an asterisk (*) next to its name, then the column 
 contains a hyperlink that you can click to open an associated OEP record. 
 &#160;</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Configuring the sorting order</p>
        <p class="BodyText">You can sort a list by clicking one of the column headings. A pointer 
 appears next to the column heading that identifies the direction in which 
 the list is currently sorted. Click a column a second time to reverse 
 sort the list. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Using the LCD you can configure the list to sort by up to three columns 
 each time it loads. Under the <b>Sort</b> 
 label are three dropdown lists. Each list contains the names of the columns 
 that appear in the Selected Fields list box. Select a column in one or 
 more of the drop down lists to use as sort criteria. For each dropdown 
 list that contains a column name for sorting, select a sort order by clicking 
 the icon to the right of the list. The <img src="../Resources/Images/iconsortasc0.gif" /> icon indicates an 
 ascending sort, while the <img src="../Resources/Images/iconsortdesc0.gif" /> icon indicates a descending sort. </p>
        <p class="Note_1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">You cannot sort a list from a detail area field by using 
 the mouse. Use the LCD to configure a list to sort by a detail area field.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Maximum row retrieval</p>
        <p class="BodyText">You can limit the number of records the list will retrieve when it searches. 
 Type a value in the Maximum Rows text box to set the limit for the search. 
 If your search exceeds the limit set here, the row counter changes color 
 and an asterisk (*) appears next to it in the bottom border of the list.
