        <p class="BodyText">Incident records can be cloned to create new, nearly identical records. 
 This feature is most often used to create similar records without having 
 to spend the time copying important data from one record to another.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The new record can be an incident of the same type as the source record, 
 or it can be a work ticket. If you do clone an incident record to a work 
 ticket, you have the option to link the new work ticket to the source 
 incident automatically.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Click <img src="../Resources/Images/btnClone0.gif" /> at the top of the incident information window 
 to clone the incident record. A dialog box appears asking whether you 
 want to clone the incident to another incident or a work ticket. If the 
 new record is to be a work ticket, check <b>Link 
 the new work ticket to this incident</b> if you want to link the two 
 records.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Click <img src="../Resources/Images/btnClone0.gif" /> to open the appropriate edit window. The fields 
 in the window are automatically populated with the information from the 
 source record. Complete or correct the information as necessary and click 
 <img src="../Resources/Images/iconsave0.gif" /> to save the new record.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Only the data that has been saved to the database is copied from the 
 source incident to the cloned record. Save any changes to the source data 
 before clicking the clone button.</p>
        <p class="Note_1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">All fields marked with an asterisk are required and must 
 contain data before the new record can be saved.</p>
