        <p class="BodyText">Customer product data can be edited through the product 
 information window. This window contains information that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Identifies the product by name and serial number</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Indicates the amount ordered by the customer</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Identifies the individual to contact regarding 
 the product</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Identifies a code used to track the product against 
 a campaign</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Indicates when the product order was added to 
 the system</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText">By default, the window is divided into two halves. The top half contains 
 the primary product information, and the bottom half lists the product 
 line items and linked documents. </p>
        <p class="BodyText" align="left">Edit the product information by typing in the text boxes 
 and selecting items from the drop-down lists. In addition to the editable 
 text boxes, the product information window has five other important functions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ListBullet_1"><a href="Selecting_products.htm">Product selection</a>
            </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1"><a href="Selecting_contacts.htm">Contact selection</a>
            </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1"><a href="Selecting_tracking_codes.htm">Tracking 
 code selection</a>
            </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1"><a href="Editing_line_items.htm">Line item editing</a>
            </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1"><a href="attached_documents.htm">Attached documents</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText">When adding a new product, you can clear the information you've entered 
 by clicking <img src="../Resources/Images/iconerase0.gif" />. This button is not visible when you are 
 making changes to product information that has already been saved.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">To assign the active product to a different customer record, click IMG. 
 Use the <a href="Search-for_a_company_or_individual.htm">Customer search</a> 
 window to select a new owner for the product record. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">When you are finished working with the product 
 record, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconsave0.gif" /> to save your changes. Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconDelete0.gif" /> to delete the product record.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Use the <img src="../Resources/Images/iconarrowup0.gif" /> and <img src="../Resources/Images/iconarrowdown0.gif" /> buttons 
 to expand and contract (hide) the two halves of the window as follows:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li class="ListBullet_1">From the window's baseline state, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconarrowup0.gif" /> to contract the primary product information (click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconarrowdown0.gif" /> to expand the primary product information and restore the 
 window's baseline state). </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">From the window's baseline state, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconarrowdown0.gif" /> to contract the product line items (click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconarrowup0.gif" /> to 
 expand the product line items and restore the window's baseline state).</li>
        </ul>
