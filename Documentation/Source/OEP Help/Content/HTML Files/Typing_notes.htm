            <MadCap:keyword term="Work notes" />Work notes help you track the progress of work tickets, incidents, and 
 tasks. Each time you update a record you can type notes to provide additional 
 information that cannot be saved using the drop down lists, check boxes, 
 and small text boxes that are available on OEP windows. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Click the <b>Notes</b> tab to view 
 the notes for the current record. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Each time an OEP record is saved the work notes are marked with an informational 
 header. This header identifies the user who typed the notes and indicates 
 the date and time when the notes were saved to the database. Existing 
 notes are listed in the order they were added to the record, with the 
 oldest ones appearing at the top of the note area. Individual sets of 
 notes can be hidden by clicking <img src="../Resources/Images/iconnodecloseoff.gif" style="border-style: none;border: none;width: 10px;height: 10px;float: none;border-style: none;" width="10" height="10" border="0" />. Only the note header 
 with the timestamp and user ID remains visible. Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconnodeopenoff.gif" style="border-style: none;border: none;width: 10px;height: 10px;float: none;border-style: none;" width="10" height="10" border="0" /> to 
 reveal the hidden notes.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The notes area is divisible into two sections, one for the existing 
 notes and one for typing new notes. To view only the existing notes, click 
 <img src="../Resources/Images/iconmaxsavednotes0.gif" />. To view only new notes, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconmaxnewnotes0.gif" />. To split 
 the window to view both existing and new notes, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconsplitnotes0.gif" />.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">If you save work notes without closing the work ticket, incident, or 
 task window, a draft of your notes appears in the existing notes section. 
 These notes are updated with each repeated save until the window is closed. 
 Draft notes appear in italics, and the text <b>Saved 
 Draft</b> is appended to the header. You can continue to edit the notes 
 in the new notes section until you save the record and close the window.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">To check the spelling of your unsaved notes, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconspell0.gif" style="border-style: none;border: none;width: 23px;height: 22px;float: none;border-style: none;" width="23" height="22" border="0" />.
