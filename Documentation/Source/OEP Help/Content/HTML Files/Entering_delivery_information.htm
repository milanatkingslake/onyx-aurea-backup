        <p class="BodyText">The top half of the message tab contains the options for mail delivery 
 including to and from addresses, subject information, message priority, 
 and attachments. </p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Address selection</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Using the <b>From</b> menu, select 
 an email address to which the recipient(s) 
 can reply. This can be your OEP user email address or one of the queues 
 your system uses to process emails (for example, support@your_company.com). 
 </p>
        <p class="BodyText">To specify recipients for the email, click any of the following three 
 buttons: <b>To</b>, <b>Cc</b>, 
 or <b>Bcc</b>. The Select Recipients 
 window appears. This window has three tabs. You can select recipients 
 from the customer database, from the OEP user tree, or from your system 
 queues. </p>
        <p class="TaskHeading">To select customers as recipients:</p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Click the Customer tab to reveal a search form. 
 </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Enter search criteria.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconFind0.gif" /> to perform the search.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Check the box for each customer you want to add 
 as a recipient. </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Click the button for the appropriate address type 
 (To for main primary address, Cc for carbon copy, and Bcc for blind carbon 
 copy).</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="TaskHeading">To select OEP users as recipients:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Click the Internal Users tab to reveal the user 
 list hierarchy.</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">Click a group 
 name to expand its list of users or subgroups.
            </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Click one or more names to select them.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Click the button for the appropriate address type 
 (To for main primary address, Cc for carbon copy, and Bcc for blind carbon 
 copy).</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="TaskHeading">To select system queues as recipients:</p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Click the Queues tab to reveal the list of mail 
 queues. </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Check the box for reach row you want to add as 
 a recipient.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Click the button for the appropriate address type 
 (To for main primary address, Cc for carbon copy, and Bcc for blind carbon 
 copy).</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="BodyText">You can also type email addresses (and OEP user names) directly into 
 the address lines without using the Select Names window. Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconchecknames0.gif" /> (or press CTRL-K) to verify that the addresses exist for 
 individuals, OEP users, or system queues (this will not search company 
 records for valid email addresses). If there are multiple matches for 
 an address, a dialog box appears that allows you to pick the correct recipient. 
 If an address has no known matches, you can edit it or click <b>Ignore</b> 
 to override OEP's objections and use it in the email anyway. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Check or uncheck 
 <b>Show Bcc</b> to toggle the appearance 
 of the blind carbon copy (Bcc) address line. Even if the line is not visible, 
 you can still select Bcc recipients using the Select Recipients window. 
 </p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Other delivery options</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Type a subject for the mail in the Subject line. The subject of the 
 mail will also appear in any OEP lists in which this email appears. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">You can set an importance level for your email messages by selecting 
 a priority level from the priority drop down menu on the Recipients toolbar. 
 There are three levels: Low, Normal, and High. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">To mark the email for follow up, click <img src="../Resources/Images/followup_1.gif" />. The follow up 
 designation is local to OEP only. Recipients of the message will not have 
 the email marked for follow up when they receive it. You can also mark 
 sent and received emails for follow up for your own purposes. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">To select files to attach to the email, see <a href="Adding_attachments.htm">Adding 
 attachments</a>. </p>
