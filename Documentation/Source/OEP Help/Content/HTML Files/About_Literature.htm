        <p class="BodyText">The Literature feature manages customer mail, email, and fax orders 
 for electronic files or printed material.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">You can create orders for any combination of products. After you define 
 the order, OEP assigns it to the fulfillment server, freeing your workstation 
 to continue with other tasks. Examples of different literature requests 
 include technical, marketing, and promotional information.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">You can process a literature order immediately or in a batch. If your 
 customer requires the order as soon as possible, you can choose to mark 
 it for immediate real-time processing. Otherwise, OEP processes all orders 
 once a day, at a time specified by your system administrator.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Click <b>Literature </b>within the 
 Customer submenu on the Navigation bar to view the literature orders for
