            About OEP User Selection</H3>
        <p class="BodyText">The select user dialog box appears when you need to save the name of 
 an OEP user as part of another OEP entity (for example, to appoint a user 
 to monitor an incident) or when you need to include an OEP user as a search 
 criterion. From the dialog box you can search by a user's full name or 
 review lists of user names arranged in group hierarchies.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The dialog box has two tabs. <b>User Search</b> 
 provides for user searches by user name, user ID, or any part of either, 
 while <b>User Tree</b> lists users by 
 group. When the dialog box loads, it automatically performs a search based 
 on the contents of the text box with which it is associated. User names 
 that cannot be found are listed first, as the dialog box gives you a chance 
 to search again for the correct name(s).</p>
        <p class="TaskHeading">To search for a user by name:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">If necessary, click the <b>User 
 Search tab to reveal the Search For</b> 
 text box.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Type search criteria in the box and click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconFind0.gif" />.
            </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">If the appropriate 
 user name appears in the result list, click it to select the user and 
 close the dialog box. Otherwise, repeat step 2 to perform the search again.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="BodyText">Within the user tree, groups are represented with the <img src="../Resources/Images/imgGroup.gif" /> icon, and individual users are represented by the <img src="../Resources/Images/imgUser.gif" /> icon.</p>
        <p class="TaskHeading">To select a user from the user tree:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Click the <b>User 
 Tree</b> tab to reveal the user 
 list hierarchy.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Click a group 
 name to expand its list of users or subgroups.
            </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Click a user 
 name to select it.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="BodyTextIndent_2">The dialog 
 box closes and the user name appears in the text box in the previous window.
