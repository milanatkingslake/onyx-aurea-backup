        <p class="BodyText">Although this documentation strives to provide you with the most accurate 
 and complete information about OEP, your specific experience with the 
 system may be slightly different than what is presented here. This is 
 due to two important factors: customizations and permissions.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Customizations</p>
        <p class="BodyText">OEP was designed to be modified by the people that implement it. Because 
 of this, your system will most likely have adaptations that maximize OEP's 
 effectiveness within your organization. Contact your OEP system administrator 
 to obtain the information necessary for using the custom and updated features 
 of your OEP installation.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Permissions</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Every OEP user account is assigned permissions 
 that dictate what the user can and cannot do to the customer information 
 stored in the database. Your user account may be prohibited from viewing, 
 adding, updating, or deleting certain types of customer records. In cases 
 where the account permissions restrict certain actions, OEP hides or disables 
 the buttons normally used to accomplish those tasks. For example, if your 
 account permissions state that you cannot delete customer records, the 
 delete button will not appear in OEP when you are viewing customer data. 
 If you need but do not have access to a feature or an action that is described 
 in this documentation, contact your OEP system administrator. </p>
