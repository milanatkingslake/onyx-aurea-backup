            <MadCap:keyword term="Searching" />General record searching in OEP is done from a dedicated search screen 
 with fields for entering a wide variety of search criteria. Searches can 
 be performed to find customer records, incident information, or work tickets.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">All records that match your search criteria appear in a results list 
 in the Data Area frame.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">A few other features within OEP offer their own search tools. These 
 tools operate in a similar fashion to the main Search feature of OEP, 
 that is, they follow the same rules regarding search delimiters and criteria 
 selection.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">You can also merge customer records through the Search feature. Merging 
 is a process that combines similar customer records to reduce unnecessary 
 duplication.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Available from the Navigation bar is the QUICK! Search feature. With 
 QUICK! Search, you can hunt for a record using a single criterion.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">When you have to search the system for the name of another OEP user, 
 a dialog box exists that provides a simple search feature and also lists 
 users according to group membership.</p>
