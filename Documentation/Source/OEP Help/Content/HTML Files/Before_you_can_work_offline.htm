        <p class="BodyText">Before you can work offline, you must configure your Microsoft Outlook 
 profile for offline use and set your synchronization preferences. See 
 the OEP-Offline Getting Started Guide and be sure you have completed all 
 tasks required to configure your Outlook profile for offline use.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Once you have configured your Outlook profile, determine which data 
 you want to access offline and subscribe to that data in OEP. To initiate 
 synchronization, Outlook must be running while you are connected to the 
 network, and you must initiate synchronization appropriately for your 
 Outlook version and profile configuration. After Outlook synchronization 
 is complete, launch OEP-Offline to access your subscribed data. Your changes 
 will be saved locally until you reconnect to the network and synchronize 
 with OEP again.</p>
        <p class="Note_1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Connection modes and synchronization are configured in Outlook. 
 See the Help for your version of Outlook for more information.</p>
