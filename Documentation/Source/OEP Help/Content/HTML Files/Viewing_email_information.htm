        <p class="BodyText">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Email" />Email information is visible from the Email tab on the bottom half of 
 the PowerPage and the incident information window. Click the tab to view 
 the list of emails associated with the record. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Because an OEP record may have dozens or hundreds of emails associated 
 with it, the contents of the list can be reduced by configuring the filter. 
 Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconshowfilter0.gif" /> to view the filter criteria panel. The panel has 
 three sections to it. Criteria from one, two, or all three sections can 
 be combined to activate the filter. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Obsolete">The criteria options are identical 
 to those available from Task Manager.</MadCap:conditionalText> When you have configured the filter, 
 click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconFind0.gif" /> to refresh the list using the new criteria. If you 
 have set default criteria through the <a href="Email_preferences.htm">Email 
 Preferences</a> then the filter will use this criteria when the list first 
 loads. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Emails can appear in a customer's list if the customer is the primary 
 or a carbon copy (cc) recipient of the email. If the customer is a blind 
 carbon copy (bcc) recipient, the email will not appear in their list. 
 </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Emails also appear in the list if they have been manually linked to 
 the customer or incident record. See <a href="adding_oep_links.htm">Adding 
 OEP links</a> for more information on linking an email to a customer or 
 incident record. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">The list has columns that identify the emails that have been marked 
 for follow up (<img src="../Resources/Images/followup_1.gif" />), those that have attachments (<img src="../Resources/Images/attachment_1.gif" />), and those that are unsent drafts (<img src="../Resources/Images/sent_0.gif" style="border-style: none;border: none;width: 16px;height: 16px;float: none;border-style: none;" width="16" height="16" border="0" />). </p>
        <p class="BodyText">For more information on viewing and sorting the records within the list 
 of emails, see <a href="Using_lists.htm">Using results lists</a>. </p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Managing email information</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The email information window appears any time you compose a new email 
 or review a draft or sent email. For more information about this window, 
 see <a href="Managing_Email_information.htm">Managing email information</a>.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">To view an existing email, click a row in the list.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">To create a new email using a template, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconemailtemplate0.gif" />. See <a href="About_Email_Templates.htm">About 
 Email Templates</a> for more information about creating emails from predefined 
 templates. To create a new email without using a template, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconAdd0.gif" />. You can switch between the two options by selecting one 
 from the drop-down list. </p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Deleting emails</p>
        <p class="BodyText">To delete one or more emails, check the box in the far left column of 
 each email you want to delete. Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconDelete0.gif" /> to remove the emails 
 from the list and delete them from the system. </p>
