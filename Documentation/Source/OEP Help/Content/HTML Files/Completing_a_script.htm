        <p class="BodyText">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Scripts:Completing" />Data for scripts is entered into the script delivery window. The prompts 
 available in this window vary from script to script, but in general the 
 process is similar to completing a form available on a Web site. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">The top portion of the script delivery window contains a description 
 of the script's purpose and the unique identifier of the owner record 
 (customer or incident). </p>
        <p class="BodyText">You can assign any customer record as a contact for the script.</p>
        <p class="TaskHeading"><b>To assign a contact to the 
 script:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">At the top of the script delivery window, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconCreateLink0.gif" />.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="BodyTextIndent_2">The <b>Search 
 for a Customer </b>window appears.</p>
        <ol start="2">
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Enter criteria and click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconFind0.gif" /> to execute 
 the search.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Click the row of the customer you want to assign 
 to the script as a contact.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="BodyText">You can also assign the script to a different OEP user. By default the 
 script is assigned to whoever added it to the system. To assign the script 
 to another OEP user click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconopenwindow0.gif" /> to open the user search dialog. See <a href="User_selection.htm">About 
 OEP user selection</a> for more information on selecting users.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Once the script is running, follow the directions in the center of the 
 window to add the requested data to the system. When you have collected 
 the necessary information for the step, click <b>Next</b> 
 in the lower right hand corner of the window. If this step is the last, 
 the button text reads <b>Finish</b>. </p>
        <p class="Warning" MadCap:autonum=" &#160;&#160;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">You can also move between script steps by pressing alt-left 
 arrow or alt-right arrow 
 on the keyboard.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">On the left of the window there may be the list of steps that have been 
 completed. The current step is highlighted. You can click a previous step 
 to jump to it and review its contents. You can move through the steps 
 using the <b>Previous</b> and <b>Next</b> 
 buttons as needed, or click the last step in the list to return to your 
 previous position. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">If you jump to a previous step and make changes to the information, 
 the script may require you to continue the script from that point (and 
 revisit the steps that follow). Depending on the script settings you may 
 be given the option to resume the script at the step you left off. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">To reset the script session click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconerase0.gif" />. If the script session 
 is new and has not yet been saved, all data in the script is cleared. 
 If you opened an existing script session, the data in the script is reset 
 to the values already saved in the database. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">To print a summary of the data in the script, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconprint0.gif" />. 
 The script data appears in a printer-friendly format. Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconprint0.gif" /> to send the summary to your printer. </p>
