        <p class="BodyText">Scripts in OEP streamline common business processes by collecting specific 
 information through a series of forms. The information is saved to the 
 database and the script may also create one or more associated records 
 (customer, task, and incident, for example) as needed. These scripts can 
 save you the time required to perform certain tasks. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Scripts can be assigned to customer and incident records. To view the 
 list of scripts assigned to a customer, click the <b>Scripts</b> 
 tab on the bottom half of the PowerPage. To view the lists of scripts 
 assigned to an incident record, click the <b>Scripts</b> 
 tab on the bottom half of the incident information window. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">The purpose and function of the scripts available 
 to you will depend on the features of your OEP system. For more information 
 about a specific script, contact your system administrator. </p>
