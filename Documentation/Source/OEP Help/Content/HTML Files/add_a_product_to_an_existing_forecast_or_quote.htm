        <p class="BodyText">Each forecast and quote contains one or more products that comprise 
 a possible customer order. Products are selected through the Forecast/Quote 
 Line Detail window. Through this window you can specify product quantities, 
 name prices, grant discounts, set shipping dates, and predict closing 
 probabilities. The exact combination of properties available depends on 
 the specifics of your system, but the most common options are described 
 here.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Selecting products</p>
        <p class="BodyText">To select a product for a forecast or quote, navigate through the Selected 
 Product tree. Products in the tree are arranged in group hierarchies. 
 The <img src="../Resources/Images/iconFolderSmall.gif" /> icons represent the groups and the <img src="../Resources/Images/iconProductSmall.gif" /> icons represent the products. Locate a product and click 
 <img src="../Resources/Images/iconProductSmall.gif" /> to select it. Type the number of products the customer 
 may want to purchase in the <b>Quantity</b> 
 box.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Applying discounts</p>
        <p class="BodyText">After you select a product, pricing information appears in the <b>Unit Price</b> box. Below this box are <b>Discount</b> settings. You can grant discounts 
 in two ways: as a percentage of the unit price, or as a numeric reduction 
 on the unit price. To apply a discount, select a type from the list box 
 (<b>Amount</b> or <b>Percent</b>) 
 and type a number in the <b>Value</b> 
 box. The total discount is calculated and applied to the extended total 
 for the line item.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Setting close probabilities</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Closing probabilities for forecasts can be set in individual products 
 in the forecast and on the entire forecast itself. To set the probability 
 for an individual item, type a value in the <b>Confidence</b> 
 box. When you close the Forecast/Quote Line Detail window, the confidence 
 values for the line items and the total forecast are combined and the 
 adjusted price total of the forecast appears in the forecast summary. 
 See <a href="Change_Forecast_Properties.htm">Editing properties</a> for 
 information on setting a confidence value for an entire forecast.</p>
