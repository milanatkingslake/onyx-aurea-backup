        <p class="BodyText">Literature data can be edited through the literature 
 order information window. This window contains information that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Identifies the literature products ordered by 
 or for the customer</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Shows the distribution methods for the literature 
 products (including delivery information such as fax numbers and street 
 addresses)</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Identifies a code used to track the literature 
 order against a campaign</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Indicates when the literature order was added 
 to the system</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText">The literature order information window is divided into two halves. 
 The top half contains the order information and the bottom half lists 
 the literature products that comprise the order. There are tabs on the 
 top half that display information regarding the order's main details, 
 email and fax messages, and attached documents.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The default tab for a literature order is the <b>Main</b> 
 tab. This tab contains information regarding shipping and processing information 
 for the order. You can select one of the addresses the customer has on 
 file, or you can type a new one in the <b>Ship 
 To</b> box. If the literature order contains a fax document, you can 
 type a telephone number in the <b>Fax</b> 
 box. If you do not supply a number, OEP will use the fax number stored 
 in the customer record.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">You can also specify a processing priority for the order. There are 
 buttons for <b>Batch</b> and <b>Immediate</b> 
 processing. Contact your OEP system administrator for information on the 
 frequency of which literature orders are processed based on their priority 
 setting.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">You can also specify a processing priority for the order. There are 
 buttons for <b>Standard</b> and <b>High</b> processing. Contact your OEP system 
 administrator for information on the frequency of which literature orders 
 are processed based on their priority setting.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Edit the order information by typing in the text boxes 
 and selecting items from the drop-down lists. In addition to the editable 
 text boxes, the literature order information window has four other important 
 functions. They are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ListBullet_1"><a href="edit_a_literature_order.htm">Literature 
 product selection</a>
            </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1"><a href="Selecting_tracking_codes.htm">Tracking 
 code selection</a>
            </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1"><a href="Managing_messages.htm">Message management</a>
            </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1"><a href="attached_documents_literature.htm">Attached 
 documents</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText">When you are finished working with the literature order, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconsave0.gif" /> to save your changes.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">To delete the order from the system, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconDelete0.gif" />. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconerase0.gif" /> when you are creating 
 a new literature order to clear any information in the text boxes. </p>
