        <p class="BodyText">The Incidents feature provides the primary means for tracking activities 
 associated with a customer. Incidents exist in three different standard 
 types: sales opportunity, service request, and support incident. These 
 types are explained in further detail below. All incidents are tied to 
 a customer record during their lifespan. Incident summary information 
 is visible from a customer record in the PowerPage.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Incidents can be retrieved from a customer <a href="Access_the_Companies_or_Individuals_PowerPage.htm">PowerPage</a> 
 record, or through searches in <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Obsolete"><a href="About_Task_Manager.htm">Task Manager</a>, </MadCap:conditionalText> <a href="about_quick_search.htm">QUICK! Search</a> or <a href="Navigator.htm">Navigator</a>.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Incidents can be broken into smaller pieces called tasks. Each incident 
 can use one or more tasks to divide the work of an incident among several 
 users or into more manageable portions.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Each incident can have a revenue forecast or purchasing quote attached 
 to it. These items are part of the Forecast and Quotes feature. A forecast 
 is a sales projection and a quote is a formal offer to a customer (which 
 is usually followed by an order).</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Sales opportunities</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Sales opportunities are incidents that track interactions with a customer 
 during a sales cycle. Through a sales opportunity you can record the progress 
 of a potential sale to a customer from the initial contact through the 
 final order.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Create a sales opportunity each time you establish contact with a potential 
 (or existing) customer regarding a possible sale. During the sales process 
 record each telephone call, meeting, and presentation. By recording these 
 instances you can easily review and monitor your sales pipeline at any 
 time during the sales process.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Service requests</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Service requests are incidents that track the progress of customer service 
 issues. Through a service request you can log incoming service calls, 
 capture status changes, record actions taken, hand out assignments, and 
 track the amount of work completed.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">By tracking and measuring the relevant details of your service requests, 
 you can establish a proactive method for managing your customer service 
 needs, thereby ensuring the highest possible level of customer care.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Support incidents</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Support incidents are incidents through which you can manage problematic 
 issues customers have with your products and services.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">By collecting information about customers when they call for support 
 and assistance, you can then measure the amount of effort your organization 
 is dedicating to specific issues or customers. With this information you 
 can identify where to focus your resources to manage customer problems 
 most effectively.</p>
