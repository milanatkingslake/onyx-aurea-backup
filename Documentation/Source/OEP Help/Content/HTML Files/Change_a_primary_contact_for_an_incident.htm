            <MadCap:keyword term="External contacts" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Internal contacts" />Each incident can be assigned a number of different contacts. Within 
 the incident information window there are tabs for external contacts and 
 internal contacts. Click the appropriate tab to view the list of contacts 
 for each type. Each incident record can also have a primary contact. This 
 person is highlighted on the incident information window as the principal 
 human link between the incident and your organization.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">For more general information about contacts, see <a href="about_contacts.htm">About 
 Contacts</a>.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Primary contact</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Each incident record can have a single primary contact. If the incident 
 owner is an individual, OEP uses the individual as the default primary 
 contact. If the incident owner is a company, OEP uses the company record's 
 primary contact as the default primary contact (unless the company record 
 has no primary contact. In this case, no primary contact is assigned to 
 the incident). You can select a different person to be the contact if 
 necessary.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconBrokenLink0.gif" /> to unlink a primary contact from an incident record. 
 The name of the contact reverts to the default value.</p>
        <p class="TaskHeading">To assign a primary contact to an incident record:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">From the incident information window, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconCreateLink0.gif" /> beside the <b>Primary Contact</b> 
 area.</li>

 for a Primary Contact</b> window appears.</p>

        <p class="Note_1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">If the search returns only one individual record, the search

 the incident.</p>

 the contact's underlined name in the incident information window.</p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">External and internal contacts</p>
        <p class="BodyText">As an incident record can have multiple internal and external contacts, 
 the function of the contacts can be identified through the use of contact 
 types. These types are selected by your organization and usually indicate 
 the specific function of the contact. For example, types might include: 
 Field Service, IT Manager, and Customer Service Representative.</p>
