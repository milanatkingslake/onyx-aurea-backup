        <p class="BodyText">Cascaded subscriptions automatically extend manual subscriptions to 
 related items, based on subscription rules. For instance, suppose your 
 company's business rules require you to have offline access to an incident’s 
 tasks. Your system administrator can create a subscription rule that automatically 
 subscribes the related tasks to you when you subscribe to an incident. 
 </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Where your system administrator has set cascade rules, 
 cascaded subscriptions are also created for any new or updated items that 
 are related to the one to which you had previously subscribed. For instance, 
 suppose the following: </p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li class="ListBullet_1">There is a subscription rule that ensures that 
 when you subscribe to an incident, you are automatically subscribed to 
 all the tasks of that incident. Subsequently, when a new task is created 
 for that incident, a subscription to that new task is automatically created 
 for you. </li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">There is a subscription rule that automatically 
 subscribes a company's primary contact to you when you subscribe to the 
 company. Subsequently, when the primary contact for that company is changed 
 to another individual, a subscription to the company’s new primary contact 
 is automatically created for you. You would, however, need to manually 
 unsubscribe 
 from the previously subscribed primary contact (individual).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText">Unsubscribing items can affect subsequent cascaded subscriptions. When 
 you unsubscribe from an item, a block is put on that item that limits 
 how it is re-subscribed to you in the future. This is to lessen the likelihood 
 that you will be inadvertently resubscribed to the item. For more details, 
 see <a href="Unsubscribing_from_records.htm">Unsubscribing from data</a>.</p>
        <p class="Note_1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The previous examples assume cascaded subscription behavior 
 based on subscription relationships and rules that may not be configured 
 on your system. Your system administrator determines the relationships 
 and rules that result in cascaded subscriptions. Contact your system administrator 
 for information about the subscription relationships and rules that affect 
 cascaded subscriptions for your system. </p>
        <p class="ElementHeader">Cascaded unsubscriptions and deletions</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Cascaded unsubscriptions and deletions occur as well. For instance, 
 if you subscribe to a company but then subsequently unsubscribe or delete 
 the company, cascaded unsubscriptions or deletions occur for all the incidents 
 owned by that company and all the tasks owned by those incidents. Note, 
 however, that if you were to unsubscribe or delete an incident, while 
 the tasks owned by that incident would be unsubscribed or deleted, the 
 customer that owns that incident would not be unsubscribed or deleted.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The cascade rules that govern this behavior are called required rules. 
 They are based on existing OEP rules that require that certain items belong 
 to and cannot exist without other items. For instance, you cannot create 
 a task without assigning it to an incident, and you cannot create an incident 
 without assigning it to a customer, but you can have an incident without 
 tasks, and you can have a customer without incidents.</p>
