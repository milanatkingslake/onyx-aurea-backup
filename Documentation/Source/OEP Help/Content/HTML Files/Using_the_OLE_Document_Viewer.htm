        <p class="BodyText">The OLE Attachment Viewer is a small application that lets OEP users 
 view attached document files that were uploaded through the OEP - Windows 
 Client application (formerly known as Onyx Customer Center). Because of 
 changes to the way attached files are handled, the OEP Web client cannot 
 handle these files without help from a separate application.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">When you click a link to an attachment that was uploaded via the Windows 
 client, the OLE Attachment Viewer appears and locates the application 
 on your computer that is registered for opening the file type of the attachment. 
 If no application on your system is registered to handle the file, Windows 
 creates a list of available applications and invites you to choose one.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The viewer only has the capability to open the files from the server. 
 You cannot add any descriptive information to an attached file that was 
 uploaded using the Windows client.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">You can obtain progress information during file download by clicking 
 the <b>Show Details</b> button in the 
 main viewer window.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The OLE Attachment Viewer must be installed 
 on your computer by running a special setup program. Contact your system 
 administrator for information on obtaining the installation files for 
 the OLE Attachment Viewer. </p>
