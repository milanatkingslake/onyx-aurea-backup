        <p class="BodyText">If you notice that duplicate records for a single customer exist in the Onyx  system, you can merge the records into a single customer record.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">If both the source record and target record contain data in the same fields, only the data in the target record is retained. Data from the source record is merged into the target record only if the target record does not already contain data in those fields. All other data in the source record is lost (the source record is deleted after the merge is complete).</p>
        <p class="BodyText">All database items that are associated with the source record, such 
 as phone, address, work ticket, email, script, and incident records, are 
 automatically assigned to the target record.</p>
        <p class="TaskHeading">To merge records</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Perform a search to generate a result list that contains the customers to be 
merged. This can be done only from Company and Individual search entities.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Determine which record you want to retain. This record, called the target record, is typically the one that contains the most complete and accurate data.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">In the <b>Search Results</b> window, click <img src="../Resources/Images/iconmergerecords.png" />.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Two columns, <b>Source</b> and <b>Target</b> are enabled on the left of the window.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">From the result list, select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Target</span> option beside the record that you want to retain.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Source</span> 
option beside the record that you want to merge into the target record. This record is deleted when the merge process is complete.</li>
