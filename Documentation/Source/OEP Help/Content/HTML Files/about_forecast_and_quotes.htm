        <p class="BodyText">Sales and marketing teams use forecasts internally as a means of projecting 
 sales that are still in progress. You create a forecast for an incident, 
 and you can base your quotes upon that forecast. Forecasts contain a confidence-weighted 
 total price. Confidence values can be assigned to individual products 
 or to the forecast as a whole. This allows you to gauge the likelihood 
 of closing each line item included in the forecast, and the entire forecasted 
 sale.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">Quotes are used to give formal pricing information to customers. Quote 
 information can be formatted into a quote document that is distributed 
 to the customer. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Each incident in the database can have one forecast and an unlimited 
 number of quotes attached to it.</p>
