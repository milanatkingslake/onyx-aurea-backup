        <h1><a name="_Toc429560076"></a>Onyx CRM Product Virtualization</h1>
        <p>Onyx CRM products are supported on both physical servers and virtualized servers, following the same policies and procedures as for physical servers. If you choose to implement Onyx CRM solution in a virtualized environment, ensure that all system requirements are satisfied for all virtual servers. Onyx CRM considers virtualization to be an environmental factor; therefore, when a reported issue cannot be replicated by our Support teams, as sometimes happens with network security issues, and when the issue occurs only when using virtual servers, customers are asked to replicate the issue on physical servers in order to assist our Support team in replicating and isolating the source of the issue.</p>
        <p>If we discover an issue that occurs only on virtual servers and determine that it can be resolved by modifying Onyx CRM product code, we will escalate the issue following our standard customer product support guidelines.</p>
        <p>For issues that pertain to virtualized environments in general, contact your virtualization software vendor.</p>
