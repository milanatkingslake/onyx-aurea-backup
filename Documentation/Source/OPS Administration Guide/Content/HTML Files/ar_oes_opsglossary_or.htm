        <H2 class="Heading">Glossary of OPS terms </H2>
        <p class="BodyText">The following glossary describes the OPS terms used throughout the OPS 
 documentation. </p>
        <p class="BodyText"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Action batch —</b> An action batch is 
 a request from the List Manager for an action such as creating an incident 
 a list of customers. Each action batch includes a set of OEAS method calls 
 that are executed against a set of customers. </p>
        <p class="BodyText"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Action batch XML —</b> The action batch 
 XML contains the information that defines which OEAS method calls the 
 batch subsystem executes for an action batch. </p>
        <p class="BodyText"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Batch queue —</b> A batch queue contains 
 action batch items. The two types of batch queues available in OPS Administration 
 are the New Batches queue and the Completed Batches queue. </p>
        <p class="BodyText"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Batch subsystem —</b> A batch subsystem 
 processes action batches submitted through List Manager. </p>
        <p class="BodyText"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Batch system document —</b> A batch 
 system document is a system document that is generated once per batch 
 of order lines. For example, a batch system document may be used by shipping 
 or fulfillment personnel as a pick list. </p>
        <p class="BodyText"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Completed batches —</b> Completed batches 
 contain action batches that have been processed by OPS and have a status 
 of Completed. You can view completed batches in OPS Administration. </p>
        <p class="BodyText"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Completed order lines —</b> Completed 
 order lines contain order lines that have been processed by OPS and have 
 a status of Completed. You can view completed order lines in OPS Administration. 
 </p>
        <p class="BodyText"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Email fulfillment type 
 —</b> Order lines with an email fulfillment type are delivered to customers 
 as email messages. Email fulfillment types include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Email HTML in body</li>
            <li class="ListBullet_1">Email HTML as attachment</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="BodyText"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Email order line —</b> An order line 
 for a literature product with an email fulfillment type. Email order lines 
 are processed by an email subsystem. </p>
        <p class="BodyText"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Email subsystem —</b> An email subsystem 
 is a fulfillment subsystem configured with an email engine. The subsystem 
 is responsible for processing email order lines. </p>

 is an XSL file used to fulfill email order lines. This customizable template 
 is an XSL stylesheet which has commands that support data merging. Literature 
 products reference the template. When OPS processes an order line for 
 the literature product, OPS uses the template in combination with the 
 data to create a merged output document. </p>
        <p class="BodyText"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Error notification —</b> The process 
 by which the OPS service or subsystems sends the administrator notification 
 via email when an error occurs. You the OPS service to perform error notification

 for the subsystems. </p>
        <p class="BodyText"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Fulfillment queue —</b> A fulfillment

 subsystems are responsible for processing literature order lines. A fulfillment 
 subsystem is combined with either a print or email engine. Combining a

 Combining a fulfillment subsystem with an email engine makes it an email 
 subsystem. </p>
        <p class="BodyText"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Incomplete batch —</b> An incomplete

 by an action batch. </p>
        <p class="BodyText"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">List Manager feature —</b> The List 
 Manager feature is an OEP feature that enables users to create a query

 </p>
        <p class="BodyText"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Mailing labels —</b> You can configure 
 mailing labels to be printed automatically when associated print literature 
 products or physical items are fulfilled. You first create a literature

 label will automatically be generated as well. </p>
        <p class="BodyText"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Master application —</b> The master 
 application is the OEAS logical application that is used in conjunction

 subsystems, batch subsystems, and the OPS Administration tool. </p>
        <p class="BodyText"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">OPS.Administrator —</b> The OPS.Administrator 
 role represents users that are OPS system administrators. Such users are
