        <p class="BodyText">When using Basic authentication with either OPS or OnyxEmailSendStep 
 component, the respective users for OPS service or OEAS COM+ application, 
 must be configured on Exchange Server to send email on behalf of other 
 users. </p>
        <p class="BodyText">Both OPS as well as OEAS (Email Send Step) send email on behalf of other 
 users. Depending on which functionality you use, Onyx Processing Service 
 User and/or OEAS COM+ identity have email accounts on Exchange Server 
 from which they send email. When you configure 
 OEAS and OPS to use Basic authentication, Exchange Server receives credentials 
 for the user sending the email and the "from" address of the 
 email that is sent. Exchange Server verifies that either the sender's 
 email address matches the email "from" address, or that the 
 sender is authorized to send email on behalf of the other user.</p>
