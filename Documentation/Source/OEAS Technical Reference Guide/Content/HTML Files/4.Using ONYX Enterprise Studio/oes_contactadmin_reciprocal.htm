        <h4>Reciprocal relationships</h4>
        <p>Customer records in CCM can have reciprocal relationships through their external contacts. </p>
        <p>For example, after automatic reciprocation is enabled, adding John’s person record as a ‘Spouse’ contact to Sue’s person record in CCM automatically creates a two-way relationship between the John’s and Sue’s records, with ‘Spouse’ selected as the external contact type for both records in relation to each other. Similarly, adding a restaurant’s property record as an ‘Owned By’ contact to Sue’s person record results in the automatic addition of Sue as an ‘Owner Occupier’ contact to the restaurant’s property record</p>
        <p>Setting up reciprocal contacts involves adding external contact types and then enabling automatic reciprocation.</p>
        <h5>Enable automatic reciprocation</h5>
        <p>You can enable automatic reciprocation for company and individual external contact types.</p>
        <p>For example, you could enable automatic reciprocation between identical ‘Spouse’ contact types under individual, or you could enable automatic reciprocation between an ‘Owner Occupier’ contact type under individual and an ‘Owned By’ contact type under company.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To enable automatic reciprocation: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>In OES, open the Contact Type Administration tool.</li>
            <li>If needed, add external contact types and refresh your browser..</li>
            <li>Select the node for the first desired external contact.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">For example, select ‘Owner Occupier’ under <b>Individual</b>.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>In the displayed <b>Edit Contact Type</b> window, select the second contact type from the relevant drop-down list. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">For example, select ‘Owned By’ from the <b>Company reciprocal contact type </b>drop-down list.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Note the name of the selected contact type.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">In this example, the name of the selected contact type is ‘Owned By'.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Select the node for the noted contact type (the second, reciprocated external contact).</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">For example, select ‘Owned By’ under <b>Company</b>.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>In the displayed <b>Edit Contact Type </b>window, select the first contact type from the relevant drop-down list.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">For example, select ‘Owner Occupier’ from the <b>Individual reciprocal contact type</b> drop-down list.</p>
