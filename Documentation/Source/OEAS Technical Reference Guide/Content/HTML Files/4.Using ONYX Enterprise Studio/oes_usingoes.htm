        <h1>Using Onyx Enterprise Studio </h1>
        <p>The Onyx Enterprise Studio (OES) includes the administration and design 
 tools for OEAS. OES differentiates the tools by including them in either 
 the Administration Workbench or the Design Workbench: </p>
        <p>The Administration Workbench includes the administration tools, with 
 which administrators can configure many areas of the Onyx Enterprise Database. 
 </p>
        <p>The Design Workbench includes tools that require a higher level of technical 
 understanding of OEAS. Technical administrators and developers use these 
 tools to customize OEAS. </p>
        <p>For additional information regarding the OES tools, 
 see: </p>

 workbench features</a> to familiarize yourself with features that are 
 common to most of the tools. </p>
