        <h4>Defining subscription relationships </h4>
        <p>Subscription relationships are relationships between 
 subscribable objects that are based on existing OEAS object relationships. 
 They enable you to create rules that define: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Automatic (cascading) subscription behavior between 
 the primary and secondary objects in a relationship.</li>
            <li>Automatic (cascading) unsubscription behavior 
 between the primary and secondary objects in a relationship, such that 
 when an object is unsubscribed, all of its related secondary objects are 
 also unsubscribed and removed from the end-userâ€™s offline data store.</li>
            <li>Automatic (cascading) deletion behavior between 
 the primary and secondary objects in a relationship, such that when an 
 object is deleted, all of its related secondary objects are removed from 
 the offline data store of all OEP-Offline end users.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using Subscription Designer, you can manage subscription 
 relationships by: </p>
