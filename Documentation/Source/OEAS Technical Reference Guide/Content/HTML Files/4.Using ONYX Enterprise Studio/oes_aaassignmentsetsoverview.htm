Assignment Sets</h1>
        <p>An assignment set is a pool of users that can be linked to conditions. 
 Users are created as internal contacts for companies, individuals, or 
 incidents, and they are optionally assigned to incidents.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Defining assignment sets</li>
            <li>Creating internal contacts to associate with company, 
 individual, and incident conditions</li>
            <li>Assigning incidents to users</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Defining assignment sets</h4>
        <p>To define an assignment set, you must add an assignment set to an assignment 
 set node, associate users with the assignment set, and link the assignment 
 set with the appropriate conditions (of the same object type). You can 
 reuse assignment sets throughout the Assignment Tree.</p>
        <h4>Creating internal contacts for conditions</h4>
        <p>Users in assignment sets are the internal users responsible for contacting 
 customers and resolving incidents within OEP. 
 These users are created as internal contacts through their user IDs and 
 internal contact type IDs. Only users of the same object type as the active 
 assignment set are available. You can type IDs or select them from a list. 
 IDs are case-sensitive and must be entered accurately.</p>
        <h4>Assigning incidents to users</h4>
        <p>Users in incident assignment sets are optionally <i>assigned to</i> 
 incidents based on the following assignment types:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>
                Normal
                </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">Assigns incidents to a single user within the assignment set.</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>
                Round Robin
                </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">Assigns incidents to the next user in a pool of users (in turn). &#160;This 
 option keeps track of who was assigned last and determines who should 
 be assigned next.</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>
                Least Busy
                </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">Assigns incidents to the user with the lightest workload (least amount 
 of assigned incidents).</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>
                Manual assignment of incidents</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">Unlike the company and individual update process, the incident update 
 process is not configured to run on every incident update. For incidents, 
 the update process only runs when an OEP 
 user manually re-assigns an incident to a particular user called the Auto 
 Assign user. The Auto Assign user is specified through the Assigned To 
 property of an incident. You can create an incident assignment set for 
 the Auto Assign user in Assignment Administration to automatically run 
 associated incidents when the incidents update.
