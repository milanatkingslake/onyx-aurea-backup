        <h4>Resetting a user’s subscribed data </h4>
        <p>Resetting the subscribed data for a user deletes all of the existing 
 data in the user’s staging server data store and client data store and 
 recreates it from the OEDB. This measure provides a troubleshooting solution 
 for several problems, such as a user’s having difficulty receiving newly 
 subscribed records. Be careful about resorting to this solution, however, 
 because any of the user’s data that has not been upsynced will be lost 
 when his or her subscribed records are reset. When possible the user should 
 also attempt to resolve all of their synchronization errors and conflicts 
 prior to the reset to avoid any data loss. </p>
        <p>When an Administrator selects <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Reset User at Next 
 Sync</span>, the setting remains selected (even if the administrator closes 
 or refreshes Security Administration) until the next server synchronization. 
 After this synchronization, the selection of <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Reset 
 User at Next Sync</span> is canceled and the attribute is shown as not 
 selected the next time Security Administration is refreshed. The next 
 client synchronization deletes and recreates (from the staging server 
 data store) the user’s data. </p>
