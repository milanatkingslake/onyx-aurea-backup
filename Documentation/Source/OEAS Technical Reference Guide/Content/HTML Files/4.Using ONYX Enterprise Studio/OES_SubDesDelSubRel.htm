        <h5>Deleting a subscription relationship </h5>
        <p>Before deleting a subscription relationship, consider 
 the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Synchronization continues to support the cascaded 
 subscriptions that occurred prior to the subscription relationship being 
 deleted.</li>
            <li>Cascaded deletions and unsubscriptions are also 
 no longer supported for the objects of the deleted subscription relationship. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Do not delete a previously active subscription relationship 
 after deployment of OEP-Offline. Once the relationship is deleted, unsubscriptions 
 and deletions are not cascaded to the secondary objects of the relationship, 
 which can result in orphaned records in OEP-Offline. In the case of deletions, 
 the subscription_item_cleanup.sql script removes the orphaned records. In the case of unsubscriptions, 
 you must remove the orphaned records manually. </p>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To delete a subscription relationship: </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>In the navigation area, locate and select the 
 subscription relationship that you want to delete.</li>
            <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconDelete0.jpg" /> to mark the subscription 
 relationship for deletion.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">The subscription relationship name appears with 
 a strikethrough font in the navigation area (for example: <span style="x-text-line-through: normal;text-decoration: line-through;">newSubscriptionRelationship</span>). 
 </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconSave0.jpg" /> to save your changes and 
 delete the subscription relationship.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you have simply marked the subscription relationship for deletion 
 and have not yet saved the changes, you can still “undelete” the subscription 
 relationship by unmarking it for deletion. </p>
        <p>Use the following procedure to unmark a subscription relationship marked 
 for deletion. </p>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To unmark a subscription relationship marked for deletion: 
 </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>In the navigation area, locate and select the 
 subscription relationship that you previously marked for deletion. It 
 is distinguished in the navigation area by the strikethrough font of its 
 name.</li>
            <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconDelete0.jpg" /> to unmark the subscription 
 relationship for deletion.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">The strikethrough font is removed from the name, 
 and the subscription relationship is unmarked for deletion. </p>
