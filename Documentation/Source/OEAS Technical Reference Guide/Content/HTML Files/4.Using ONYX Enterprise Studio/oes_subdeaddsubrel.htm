        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>In the navigation area, navigate to and expand 
 the appropriate subscribable object to which you want to add a subscription 
 relationship, and select the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Relationships</span> 
 node.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">The Relationships view appears in the edit area. 
 </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>In the edit area, select the relationship that 
 you want to add as a subscription relationship. The list of available 
 relationships contains only those relationships that exist in the OED 
 that have not yet been created as a subscription relationship. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="ListNote" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Even though company_incident_contactId and company_task_contactId 
 are listed, they are not used in OEP. Adding these relationships to incident 
 or task objects has no effect unless you have customized OEP to use them. </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Click <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Make Subscription 
 Relationship</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">A new subscription relationship (with the same 
 name as the OED relationship you chose) appears in the navigation area 
 followed by an asterisk (*). </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>In the edit area, define the attributes for the 
 subscription relationship.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">ID -</b> The ID attribute is not 
 editable as it is a primary key field. This attribute is a unique application-defined 
 identification number given to each subscription relationship created. 
 </p>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">OED Relationship -</b> This attribute 
 is not editable. It identifies the underlying OED relationship that you 
 chose for the subscription relationship. </p>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Relationship Description -</b> This 
 attribute is not editable. It is the OED relationship description for 
 the relationship that you chose for the subscription relationship. </p>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Name -</b> This attribute is the 
 user-friendly name you provide for the subscription relationship. There 
 is no requirement for the name to have any particular relation to the 
 underlying OED relationship. The name can be a maximum of 50 characters. 
 </p>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Description -</b> The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span> 
 attribute is the brief description of the subscription relationship that 
 you provide. The description can be a maximum of 255 characters. </p>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Active -</b> The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Active</span> 
 attribute controls whether or not the subscription relationship is recognized 
 by the cascade process so that any rules or roles associated with it can 
 be used to cascade related objects. </p>
        <p class="Important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Do not set a subscription relationship to inactive 
 after deployment of OEP-Offline. Once the relationship is inactive, unsubscriptions 
 and deletions are not cascaded to the secondary objects of the relationship, 
 which can result in orphaned records in OEP-Offline. In the case of deletions, 
 the subscription_item_cleanup.sql script (see <a href="../3.Configuring OEAS Features/AR_SubRemSubItemData.htm">Removing 
 deleted data from subscription_item</a>) removes the orphaned records. 
 In the case of unsubscriptions, you must remove the orphaned records manually. </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Define the rules for the subscription relationship. 
 These rules define automatic (cascading) subscription, unsubscription, 
 and deletion behavior between the primary and secondary objects in a relationship. 
 For more information about the impact of these rules, see <a href="../2.OEAS Features/AR_CA_SubscRelatRules.htm">Subscription 
 relationships, rules, and roles</a>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Always subscribe the primary object 
 -</b> Selecting this attribute for the subscription relationship ensures 
 that when a subscriber subscribes to the secondary object in the relationship, 
 an automatic cascaded subscription is created for that subscriber to the 
 primary object in the relationship. </p>
        <p class="Warning" MadCap:autonum=" &#160;&#160;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Always subscribe the primary 
 object</span> rules that are provided by default are required rules. Changing 
 these default rules to false can adversely affect the display of records 
 in OEP-Offline. It can also cause incomplete unsubscription and deletion 
 cascades resulting in unnecessary synchronization of records and orphaned 
 offline records (records that the end-user cannot access).</p>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Subscribe primary object and cascade 
 its subscription relationships -</b> Selecting this attribute for the 
 subscription relationship ensures that when a subscriber subscribes to 
 the secondary object in the relationship, automatic cascaded subscriptions 
 are created for that subscriber to the primary object in the relationship. 
 </p>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Subscribe secondary object and cascade 
 its subscription relationships -</b> Selecting this attribute for the 
 subscription relationship ensures that when a subscriber subscribes to 
 the primary object in the relationship, automatic cascaded subscriptions 
 are created for that subscriber to the secondary objects in the relationship. 
 </p>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Cascade only the secondary objects 
 that meet this filter expression -</b> This attribute contains a SQL expression 
 used in a WHERE clause that limits the automatically subscribed secondary 
 object instances. Providing a filter expression for the subscription relationship 
 ensures that when an end-user subscribes to the primary object in the 
 relationship, automatic cascaded subscriptions are created for that subscriber 
 to only the secondary objects in the relationship that meet the filter 
 expression. This rule can only be set if you have enabled the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Subscribe 
 secondary object and cascade its subscription relationships </span>rule. 
 This attribute can be a maximum of 500 characters. </p>
        <p class="ListNote" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The filter expression must be valid SQL. Invalid SQL 
 can cause cascades involving this relationship to fail. For information 
 about creating a valid filter expression, see <a href="OES_SubDesFiltering.htm">Filtering 
 secondary object cascaded subscriptions</a>. . </p>
