        <h3>Deactivating versus deleting items</h3>
        <p>ONYX recommends that you deactivate items rather than delete them. When 
 you deactivate an item, it no longer appears to end-users for active use, 
 but the item remains in the application for records that reference that 
 item.</p>
        <p>Following are the issues you might encounter when 
 deleting versus deactivating items: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deleting domain 
 items that are referenced by transactional records</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">If you try to delete a domain item (a product 
 for example) that is referenced by a transactional record (customer product) 
 the delete process will fail. A warning message appears indicating that 
 the item cannot be deleted. The delete process failed because the item 
 is being referenced in the application by one or more transactional records. 
 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deleting domain 
 items that include subordinate items</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">In certain administration tools, if you try 
 to delete a domain item (a survey for example) that includes subordinate 
 items (survey questions) the delete process will fail. A warning message 
 appears indicating that the item cannot be deleted. To delete the survey, 
 you must first delete all of the survey questions for that survey. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deleting domain 
 items with sub-data that are also referenced by transactional records</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">If you try to delete an item such as a product 
 with sub-data (a literature product) that is referenced by one or more 
 transactional records (a customer product record), it is possible that 
 only the sub-data (the literature product) will be deleted from the database—not 
 the product itself. During the delete process, the sub-data is deleted 
 first, then the process attempts to delete the main domain item. At which 
 point, the process determines that the main domain item is referenced 
 by other domain items in the application and the delete process fails. </p>
