        <h4>Deleting or undeleting a contact type </h4>
        <p>After you mark a contact type for deletion and save your changes, you 
 cannot undo the deletion. Additionally, you cannot delete a contact type 
 if there is a record that has been associated with that contact type. 
 That association must be deleted before you can delete the contact type. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Onyx recommends that you deactivate contact types instead 
 of deleting them. When you deactivate a contact type, the contact type 
 and its associated records no longer appear to users for active use, but 
 they remain active elements of records previously associated with them. 
 See <a href="oes_Activating_or_deactivating_a_contact_type.htm">Activating 
 or deactivating a contact type</a>. </p>
