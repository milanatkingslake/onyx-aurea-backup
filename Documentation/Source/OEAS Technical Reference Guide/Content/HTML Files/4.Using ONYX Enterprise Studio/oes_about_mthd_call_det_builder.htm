        <h6>About the Method Call Detail Builder </h6>
        <p>The Method Call Detail Builder appears when you select either the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Inputs</span> or <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Outputs</span> 
 node in the Method Call Designer navigation tree. It enables you to quickly 
 auto-generate method call details for the current method call you are 
 creating. </p>
        <p>When you select the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Inputs</span> node, the Builder 
 appears in the edit area of the Method Call Designer, as demonstrated 
 in the following graphic. The demonstrated <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Inputs</span> 
 list would be the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Outputs</span> list had the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Outputs</span> node been selected in the navigation tree. 
 </p>
        <p>The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Parameters</span> list on the left side of 
 the Builder is populated according to the OEAS object and method selected 
 for the method call. It is a list of all available (existing and not disabled) 
 parameters/properties of the selected OEAS method. Any parameters/properties 
 that the Onyx Enterprise Dictionary requires for insert, update, and saveCollection 
 methods are marked with the pound sign (#) in the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Parameters</span> 
 list. </p>
        <p>The procedure for adding method call details using the Method Call Detail 
 Builder is described in <a href="OES_MethCallAddMethCallDetBui.htm">Adding 
 method call details using the Method Call Detail Builder</a>. </p>
        <p class="Important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The Method Call Detail Builder does not create all method 
 call details required for many of the OEAS methods. In addition to creating 
 method call details for the parameters/properties of the OEAS method (which 
 you can do using the Builder), you must also manually create method call 
 details for any object or collection elements required by the OEAS method. 
 For example, a method call based on the individual.insert OEAS method 
 requires that you manually create method call details for the individual, 
 phones, phone, addresses, and address elements. You must order these manually 
 created details in the sequence expected by the OEAS method. </p>
        <p>You can use the Builder any number of times to add 
 additional details as you create your method call. The Builder continues 
 to assist you as follows: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>When you click <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Build</span> 
 to add selected parameters/properties as method call details, all the 
 parameters/properties that you select in the builder are added as details 
 in the navigation tree for the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Inputs</span> or 
 <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Outputs</span> node. The application focus is on 
 the first method call detail in the selected node in the navigation tree, 
 and that method call detail’s attributes appear in the edit area. Until 
 you click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconSave0.jpg" />, all the new detail nodes are marked as having 
 unsaved changes in the navigation tree.</li>
            <li>If you select the same <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Inputs</span> 
 or <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Outputs</span> node in the navigation tree again, 
 the Builder re-appears in the edit area with a complete list of parameters/properties 
 in the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Parameters</span> list. The parameters/properties 
 previously built as method call details are not removed from the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Parameters</span> list. This allows you to create multiple 
 method call details based on the same parameter/property (as is often 
 required for saveCollection method calls). Note, however, that method 
 call details are required to have unique names. The Builder does not allow 
 you to build a method call detail whose name duplicates that of an existing 
 method call detail.</li>
            <li>Duplicate element paths are allowed. If there 
 are duplicate element paths, a message box appears prompting you to confirm 
 whether you want to continue building.</li>
        </ul>
