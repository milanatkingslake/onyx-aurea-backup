        <h5>Deleting a method call </h5>
        <p>After you mark a method call for deletion and save your changes, you 
 can not undo the deletion. </p>
        <p>You cannot delete a method call if that method call is being used within 
 OEAS (for instance, if that method call is being used by a script or a 
 merge template). You must remove the association before you can delete 
 the method call. You can remove the association either by deleting the 
 item using the method call or by assigning a new method call to that item. 
 You can also choose to deactivate the method call rather than deleting 
 it, as described in <a href="OES_MethCallActMethCall.htm">Activating or 
 deactivating a method call</a>. </p>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To delete a method call: </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>In the navigation area, select the method call 
 that you want to delete.</li>
            <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconDelete0.jpg" /> to mark the method call for 
 deletion.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">The font of the method call name is struck through 
 n the navigation area (for example: <span style="x-text-line-through: normal;text-decoration: line-through;">newMethodCall</span>).

            <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconSave0.jpg" /> to save your changes and 
 delete the method call.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">If you have marked the method call for deletion and have not yet saved 
 the changes, you can still remove the mark for deletion. </p>
