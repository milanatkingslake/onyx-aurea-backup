        <h5>Deleting lookup values from a combo box field</h5>
        <p class="Warning" MadCap:autonum=" &#160;&#160;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Once you mark a lookup value for deletion and save your 
 changes, you cannot undo the deletion. Additionally, you can not delete 
 a lookup value if there are any records in the system that are associated 
 with that lookup value. Onyx recommends that you deactivate lookup values 
 instead of deleting them. When you deactivate a lookup value, the value 
 no longer appears to users for active use, but it remains an active element 
 of records previously associated with&#160;it.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To delete a lookup value from a combo box field: </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>In the navigation area, select the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Lookup 
 Value by Fields</span> mode option to display the available nodes.</li>
            <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_symbol_plus.jpg" /> in front of the node to display 
 the fields associated with that node.</li>
            <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_symbol_plus.jpg" /> in front of the field to 
 display the lookup values associated with that field.</li>
            <li>Select the lookup value to be deleted. The edit 
 area displays the lookup value attributes.</li>
            <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconDelete0.jpg" /> to mark the value for deletion. 
 The lookup value appears with a strike-through font. For example: <span style="x-text-line-through: normal;text-decoration: line-through;">Lookup</span>.</li>
            <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconSave0.jpg" /> on the toolbar to save your 
 changes. The lookup value is deleted and no longer appears in the navigation 
 area.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To undelete a lookup value marked for deletion: </p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>To "undelete" a lookup value before 
 saving, select the item you want to restore and click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconDelete0.jpg" />. 
 You can restore any item marked for deletion as long as changes have not 
 been saved. </li>
