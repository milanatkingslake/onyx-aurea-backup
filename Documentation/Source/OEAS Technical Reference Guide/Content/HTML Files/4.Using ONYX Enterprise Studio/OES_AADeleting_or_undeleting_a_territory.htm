        <h4>Deleting and undeleting items</h4>
        <p>After you mark an item (territory, condition, expression, or assignment 
 set) for deletion and save your changes, you cannot undo the deletion. 
 Additionally, you cannot delete items with associated records. All associations 
 must be deleted before you can delete the item. Use the following procedure 
 to delete or undelete an item in Assignment Administration. </p>
