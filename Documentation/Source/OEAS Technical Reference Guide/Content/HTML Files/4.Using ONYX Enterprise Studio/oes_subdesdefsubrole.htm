        <h4>Defining subscription roles </h4>
        <p>Subscription roles define the rules that control automatic (cascaded) 
 subscriptions to related records for a specific group of users. Subscription 
 roles are created when you assign an organizational role (as defined in 
 Security Administration) to a subscription relationship. They enable you 
 to assign a subscription rule to the organizational role so that you can 
 override the default subscription behavior for subscribers who are members 
 of that role. </p>
        <p>You can set the following three rules for a subscription 
 role: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Subscribe primary object and cascade its subscription 
 relationships</li>
            <li>Subscribe secondary object and cascade its subscription 
 relationships</li>
            <li>Cascade only the secondary objects that meet this 
 filter expression</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These three rules for a subscription role override the same rules for 
 the subscription relationship. For instance, if the <em class="Emphasis">Subscribe 
 primary object and cascade its subscription relationships</em> is true 
 for the subscription relationship but false for the subscription relationship 
 role for the Sales group, then members of the Sales group will not be 
 subscribed the primary object when they subscribe to the secondary object 
 of the relationship. For more information about using subscription roles, 
 see <a href="../2.OEAS Features/ar_ca_subscrolescombocasc.htm">Combining role-specific rules during cascade</a>. </p>
        <p>You can manage subscription roles by. </p>
