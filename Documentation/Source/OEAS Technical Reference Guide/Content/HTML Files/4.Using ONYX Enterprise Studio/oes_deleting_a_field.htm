        <h5>Deleting a field</h5>
        <p>Reference Table Administration does not enable you to delete configurable 
 fields. If you need to delete a field, you must delete the field from 
 the database manually. </p>
        <p>Fields definitions are stored in the ReferenceFields table. </p>
        <p class="Warning" MadCap:autonum=" &#160;&#160;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Before deleting any fields in the database, make sure 
 you have made a backup of your database. As a general rule, perform any 
 modifications to your database on a test database in order to insure that 
 you do not adversely impact your production database. </p>
