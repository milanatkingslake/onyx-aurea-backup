        <h3>About contact groups </h3>
        <p>Contact groups organize contacts into two different groups: Customer 
 and Internal. When contacts are associated with records, they are assigned 
 to one of these two contact groups.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Customer</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">Customer contacts are used to show relationships between customer 
 records in the database and can be used to model the customer’s organization. 
 Customer contacts apply to individuals or companies with whom you do business 
 (your customers). A good example of a customer contact relationship is 
 showing an individual as an employee of a company. Additionally, subsidiaries, 
 partners, and other company records can be linked to a main company record 
 to display the structure of the&#160;company. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Internal</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">Internal contacts are individuals within your organization appointed 
 to manage the customer. Internal contacts are used to show relationships 
 between customer records and employees (users) within your organization. 
 An example of an internal contact relationship is showing one of your 
 sales representatives as the designated sales representative for one of 
 your customers. Internal contacts are user names of your employees that 
 are defined with the Security Administration tool. </p>
        <p>There are parent/child relationships between the Customer contact groups 
 and Internal contact groups which are the parent records, and the contact 
 types that you create, which are the child records. Contact types created 
 in the Customer group are used to model your customer’s organization. 
 Contact Types created in the Internal group are used to model your organization. 
 </p>
        <p>By creating these contact relationships, users can readily view these 
 relationships and access other records and users which are connected in 
 some way to the record of interest. </p>
        <p>Contacts are found on the following types of records: Company, Incident, 
 Individual, Customer Product, and Work Tickets. </p>
