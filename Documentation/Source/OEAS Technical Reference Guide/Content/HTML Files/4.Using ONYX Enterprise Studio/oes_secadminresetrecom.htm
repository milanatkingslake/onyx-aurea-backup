        <h5>Recommendations for running the reset </h5>
        <p>When the user needing a reset is not in urgent need, the easiest approach 
 to running the reset is to run it after hours or at a time when the users 
 are not usually connecting and synchronizing. This could be done manually 
 or with a batch program that calls the OTM and updates the appropriate 
 subscriptionProfile record(s), setting the reset flag to true, using the 
 subscriptionProfile.saveCollection method. </p>
        <p>When an immediate reset is required for the user, you might want to 
 create a separate subsystem for the reset. </p>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To reset a user’s subscribed data using a separate subsystem: 
 </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>Using OPS Administration, create a separate subsystem 
 that you plan to use only for resets. Do not start it yet.</li>
            <li>Using Security Administration:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li class="List_Indent">Switch the user to be reset from the normal 
 subsystem to the reset subsystem.</li>
            <li class="List_Indent">Check the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Reset User 
 at Next Sync</span> box for the user’s subscription profile.</li>
            <li class="List_Indent">Save your changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Wait until the current cycle of the normal subsystem 
 is done to make sure all the users to be reset have been handled and are 
 not processed by the normal subsystem anymore. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">To determine when the current cycle of the normal subsystem has 
 completed, you can view the CPU usage of OPSSync.exe in Task Manager. 
 At the end of the cycle it is down to 0% until the next cycle starts. 
 </p>
        <p class="ListNote" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">More than one OPSSync.exe is listed in Task Manager if 
 you have more than one synchronization subsystem. To avoid the dilemma 
 that this can cause, consider stopping the normal subsystem(s). Once the 
 processes are no longer listed in Task Manager, you could start the reset 
 subsystem. Remember that once you have completed this task, you will need 
 to restart the other subsystems. </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Using OPS Administration, start the reset subsystem.</li>
            <li>Wait until the reset subsystem has processed all 
 the users and the reset is completed. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">To determine when the reset cycle is complete, you can use SQL Server 
 Enterprise Manager or Query Analyzer to run the following query for each 
 user that we reset: </p>
        <p class="Indent1"><code>SELECT COUNT(*)</code>
        </p>
        <p class="Indent1"><code>FROM subscription_item</code>
        </p>
        <p class="Indent1"><code>WHERE (subscription_user_id=”&lt;userID&gt;”) 
 AND (sync_action&lt;&gt;0)</code>
        </p>
        <p class="Indent1">Where &lt;userID&gt; represents the user ID of the user that you 
 are checking. </p>
        <p class="Indent1">For each user, the result of the query is 0 when all items for the 
 indicated user have been downsynced. </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Using OPS Administration, stop the reset subsystem.</li>
            <li>Using Security Administration, switch the user 
 back to the normal subsystem and save your changes.</li>
        </ol>
