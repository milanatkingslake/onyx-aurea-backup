        <h1>Territories</h1>
        <p>In Assignment Administration, creation begins at the Territories level. 
 A territory is an entity that contains <a href="#Conditio">conditions</a>. Companies 
 and individuals are associated with a territory if they meet at least 
 one of its conditions. Territories can also contain other territories 
 to provide further organization of the conditions. A geographic example 
 is country, region, state: United States (highest territory), Pacific 
 Northwest (second highest territory), and Washington (third highest territory).</p>
        <p>Under each Territories node are condition nodes for 
 individuals, companies, and incidents. Under each condition node are child 
 expressions and linked assignment sets (pools of users). Within the Assignment 
 Tree (navigation area), you can develop the following types of assignment 
 territories:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>
                Company territory
                </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">A company territory contains one or more company conditions. The first 
 condition that evaluates to true determines which territory a company 
 is associated with.</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>
                Individual territory
                </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">An individual territory contains one or more individual conditions. 
 The first condition that evaluates to true determines which territory 
 an individual is associated with.</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>
                Incident territory
                </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">An incident territory contains one or more incident conditions. The 
 first condition that evaluates to true determines which territory an incident 
 is associated with.</p>
        <p class="Indent1">You can create an incident territory when your business rules for routing 
 incidents do not require properties of the company or individual objects.</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>
                Combined territory
</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">A combined territory contains one or more incident conditions <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> 
 one or more customer conditions. For company or individual records, the 
 first condition that evaluates to true determines which territory they 
 are associated with.</p>
        <p class="Indent1">Incident conditions in a combined territory are only evaluated if the 
 incident's owner is also associated with the territory. The first condition 
 that evaluates to true determines which territory the incident is associated 
 with.</p>
        <p>You can create a combined territory when your business rules for routing 
 incidents require properties of the company, individual, and incident 
 objects.</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>
                Container territory
                </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">A container territory holds other territories without conditions.</p>
        <h4><a name="Conditio"></a>Conditions</h4>
        <p>Conditions contain expressions or logical statements. Expressions can 
 use any property of the company, individual, and incident objects combined 
 with operators and values. Example expression: countryCode 
 = US. The expressions in each condition refer to the properties of the 
 related object. For example, the expressions in an individual condition 
 refer to the individual object.</p>
        <p>A territory can have any number of conditions and 
 they are used for:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Associating companies, individuals, and incidents 
 with territories.</li>
            <li>Creating internal contacts for individuals, companies, 
 and incidents.</li>
            <li>Assigning incidents to OEP users.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Evaluating conditions</h4>
        <p>The Assignment Studio evaluates conditions in order, from the top to 
 the bottom of the Assignment Tree (navigation area). Through this sequence 
 of evaluation, a company, individual, or incident record is associated 
 with the first condition that evaluates to true, even when lower conditions 
 might also evaluate to true. </p>
        <p>When a condition evaluates to true, customer and incident records are 
 associated with the appropriate internal contacts, and incidents are reassigned 
 to the appropriate internal contacts, customers, and territories. Processing 
 runs in the background and is not visible to end users. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">You can reorder processing of a territory's contained territories, 
 conditions, and expressions by using the  <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconUp0.jpg" /> and  <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconDown0.jpg" />arrows on the toolbar to reposition items. For example, you 
 could reposition a high-priority condition, such as month long campaign 
 at the top of the list of conditions to ensure first priority for processing.</p>
        <p>For more information about condition processing, see <i>About 
 processing conditions</i>.</p>
        <h4>Organizing territories</h4>
        <p>The name "territory" implies a geographic assignment; however, 
 you can organize territories by other classifications, such as market 
 sector, named accounts, and much more. Your assignment structure should 
 match your organization's business model for assigning customers and incidents.

 Studio</i>.</p>
