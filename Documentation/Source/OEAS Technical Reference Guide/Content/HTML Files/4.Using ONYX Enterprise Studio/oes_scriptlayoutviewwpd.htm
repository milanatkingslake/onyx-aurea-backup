        <h4>Viewing the script in the Script Layout View Web Page Dialog </h4>
        <p>The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Script Layout View Web Page Dialog </span>allows 
 you to view the layout of the entire script in a resizable Web Page Dialog. 
 This is a viewing-only Web Page Dialog. In it, there is no way to make 
 any changes to the script. You can, however, copy the script’s scalable 
 vector graphics (SVG) representation to the Clipboard from within the 
 <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Script Layout View Web Page Dialog</span>, then 
 paste the SVG into another program. </p>
        <p>Copying the SVG to the Clipboard actually copies two versions of the 
 SVG to the Clipboard, a text version (the XML that represents the script) 
 and a raster version (a pixel-by-pixel bitmap of the actual image in the 
 <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Script Layout View Web Page Dialog</span>). </p>
        <p>With these two copies of the SVG in the Clipboard, you can either paste 
 the XML text version of the SVG into a text editor or paste the raster 
 version of the SVG into a program that can render a bitmap. </p>
        <p>When working with the raster image, remember that if the script is very 
 large (comprising many screens), you can not copy it directly into the 
 Clipboard. However, you can use a third-party screen-capture program (such 
 as SnagIt) to concatenate all the screens into a single image and copy 
 and paste that image. </p>
        <p>When copying the text (XML) version of the script, remember that a program 
 that interprets the SVG when you paste it might not represent the script 
 in the same way that the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Script Designer Edit Layout</span> 
 area does. </p>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To view the script in the Script Layout View Web Page Dialog: 
 </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>In the navigation area, select either the script, 
 its Steps node, or one of its steps, and then click&#160;<img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconLayoutView0.jpg" />.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Script Layout View Web 
 Page Dialog </span>appears, with the script layout represented within 
 it. </p>
        <p class="Indent1">If the script layout is larger than the Web Page 
 Dialog, scroll bars appear as necessary. </p>
        <p class="Indent1">You can resize the Web Page Dialog by dragging 
 its borders. </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>To copy the SVG to the Clipboard, right-click 
 anywhere in the main area of the Web Page Dialog.</li>
            <li>To return to the Script Designer and continue 
 working with the script, close the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Script Layout 
 View Web Page Dialog</span>.</li>
