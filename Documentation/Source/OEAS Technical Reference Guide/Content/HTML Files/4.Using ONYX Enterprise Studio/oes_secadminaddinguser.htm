        <h3>Adding a user </h3>
        <p>Within Security Administration, users appear within the context of a 
 group. Use the following procedure to add a new user. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"> For information on adding a subscription profile to a user, 
 see <a href="OES_SecAdminMggUserProf.htm">Adding and deleting a user’s 
 subscription profile</a>. </p>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To add a new user: </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>In the navigation area, open <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Groups</span> 
 and then the specific group to which you want to add the user.</li>
            <li>Within the group, select either the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Users</span> node or a single user, and 
 then click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconAdd0.jpg" /> on the toolbar. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">A new user titled <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">newUserName</span> 
 appears at the bottom of the list in the navigation area, followed by 
 an asterisk&#160;(*). &#160;</p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>In the edit area, specify values for the new user 
 as follows:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li class="List_Indent"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">User ID -</b> 
 Enter a unique string for the user ID. You can only change the user's 
 ID in this required field when you create the user, and you must do so 
 in order to successfully create and save the new user.</li>
            <li class="List_Indent">When creating a user account, do not use the following characters 
 in the userId. They are not supported.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="BulletList2">Less than (‹) </li>
            <li class="BulletList2">Greater than (›) 
 </li>
            <li class="BulletList2">Double quotes (") 
 </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="List_Indent"> <b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Language -</b> 
 Select a language for the user.</li>
            <li class="List_Indent"> <b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Group -</b> 
 Select a group for the user to belong to. Because group names do not have 
 to be unique, the groups are identified in the box by the group name followed, 
 in parentheses, by the group ID. For example, if the group name is “Sales” 
 and the group ID is “Sales-USA,” then the group is identified in this 
 box as “Sales (Sales-USA).” A second group named “Sales” whose group ID 
 is “Sales-Europe” would be identified in this box as “Sales (Sales-Europe).” 
 
            The default value for this list box is the 
 name of the group in which you created the user. When you select another 
 group from the list and then save changes with the user selected, in the 
 navigation area, the user’s node moves to that group. 
            If the user does not belong to a group, then 
 the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Group</span> box can be left blank. Users saved 
 with no group are listed in the “Users [No Group]” group node. 
            </li>
            <li class="List_Indent"> <b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Group -</b> 
 Select a group for the user to belong to. Because group names do not have 
 to be unique, the groups are identified in the box by the group name followed, 
 in parentheses, by the group ID. For example, if the group name is “Sales” 
 and the group ID is “Sales-USA,” then the group is identified in this 
 box as “Sales (Sales-USA).” A second group named “Sales” whose group ID 
 is “Sales-Europe” would be identified in this box as “Sales (Sales-Europe).” 
 
            The default value for this list box is the 
 name of the group in which you created the user. When you select another 
 group from the list and then save changes with the user selected, in the 
 navigation area, the user’s node moves to that group. 
            If the user does not belong to a group, then 
 the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Group</span> box can be left blank. Users saved 
 with no group are listed in the “Users [No Group]” group node. 
            </li>
            <li class="List_Indent"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Allow Impersonation 
 of Other Users -</b> (OPS only) This box must be selected for the OPS 
 Service user account. This option is used by OPS for login and session 
 management and OEP email processing. Do not select this box when configuring 
 other user accounts.
            </li>
            <li class="List_Indent"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Active -</b> 
 Select this box to activate the user. Only activated users can log in. 
 By default, the box is selected. If the user is not active, then in the 
 navigation area, the user name either is present but unavailable (grayed 
 out and in italic) or, if you have selected <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Show 
 Only Active Users and Groups</span>, not present.
        
        </li>
            <li class="List_Indent"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">User Name -</b> 
 Enter the user’s name. This can be the user’s friendly name, or the personal 
 portion of his or her email alias. Special characters such as Less than 
 (‹), Greater than (›) &#160;or 
 Double quotes (") &#160;are 
 not supported. This field is required.</li>
            <li class="List_Indent"> <b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Email -</b> 
 Enter the user’s email address. Clicking the email envelope icon to the 
 right of the box starts an email message to the user. This field is blank 
 by default; filling it is optional.</li>
            <li class="List_Indent"> <b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Manager ID - 
 </b>Enter the Onyx user ID of the user’s manager. This field is blank 
 by default; filling it is optional.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ListNote" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">To remove a user, you deactivate it rather than delete 
 it. There is no functionality to delete a user. </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="List_Indent"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Onyx Authentication 
 -</b> Select this box to enable the user to log in with his or her Onyx 
 user name and password. By default, this box is not selected.</li>
            <li class="List_Indent"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Password -</b> 
 Enter a password for the user. The password you specify is required for 
 login only if <span style="font-weight: bold;">Onyx Authentication</span> 
 is selected. If <span style="font-weight: bold;">Onyx Authentication</span> 
 is not selected, this box is not available. The password that appears 
 in this box by default when you create a user is the password you have 
 specified as the default password in <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Security Administration 
 Preferences</span> (to open <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Security Administration 
 Preferences</span>, click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconuserpref0.jpg" /> on the toolbar). User passwords 
 in Onyx Enterprise Application Server are case-sensitive.</li>
            <li class="List_Indent"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Windows Integrated 
 Authentication -</b> Select this box to enable the user to log on with 
 integrated Windows authentication. Logging on with integrated Windows 
 authentication enables the user to access the Web site without entering 
 the Onyx user name and password. By default, this box is not selected.</li>
            <li class="List_Indent"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Domain Account 
 -</b> Enter the user’s domain account, including the domain name. The 
 syntax is &lt;domain_name&gt;\&lt;user_name&gt;. If <span style="font-weight: bold;">Windows 
 Integrated Authentication</span> is not selected, this box is not available. 
 If <span style="font-weight: bold;">Windows Integrated Authentication</span> 
 is selected, this field is required. </li>
            <li class="List_Indent"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Role Membership 
 -</b> Contains the roles to which the user has been added. You cannot 
 add a user to a role in this list; it reflects the roles to which you 
 have added the user. Note, however, that changes in role membership are 
 not immediately reflected in this list.</li>
            <li class="List_Indent"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Insert By, Insert 
 Date (GMT)- </b>These fields reflect the name of the person who added 
 the user and the date that the user was added. They are automatically 
 updated when you restart Security Administration.</li>
            <li class="List_Indent"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Insert Date 
 (GMT)-</b> This system-generated field reflects the date the user was 
 created.</li>
            <li class="List_Indent"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Update Date 
 (GMT)-</b> This system-generated field reflects the date when data for 
 the user was last updated. When you have modified and saved this user, 
 this attribute becomes <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Previous Update Date (GMT)</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Insert Date (GMT)</span>
