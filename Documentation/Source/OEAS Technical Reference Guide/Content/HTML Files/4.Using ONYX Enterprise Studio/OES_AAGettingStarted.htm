        <h5>Getting started</h5>
        <p>Following are the general steps to create a assignment territory structure 
 in Assignment Administration:</p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>Create parent/child territories in the Assignment 
 Tree. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">Territories can contain other territories 
 to provide further organization of the conditions. A geographic example 
 is country, region, state: United States (highest territory), Pacific 
 Northwest (second highest territory), and Washington (third highest territory). 
 The name "territory" implies a geographic assignment; however, 
 you can organize territories by other classifications, such as market 
 sector, named accounts, and much more.</p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Create conditions for companies, individuals, 
 and/or incidents according to your plan for territory and incident assignment.</li>
            <li>Create some expressions using properties of the 
 customer, individual, and incident objects combined with operators and 
 values.</li>
            <li>Create a customer assignment set (either company 
 or individual) and associate users by entering their user IDs and internal 
 contact types as follows.</li>
            <li>Create an incident assignment set and associate 
 users with the assignment set by entering their user IDs and internal 
 contact types. For the routing of leads, incident assignment set users 
 are optionally assigned to 
 incidents based on the following assignment set types:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li class="List_Indent">
                    Normal</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent2">Assigns incidents to a single user within the assignment set.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="List_Indent">
                    Round Robin
                    </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent2">Assigns incidents to the next user in a pool of users (in turn). &#160;This 
 option keeps track of who was assigned last and determines who should 
 be assigned next.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="List_Indent">
                    Least Busy
                    </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent2">Assigns incidents to the user with the lightest workload (least amount 
 of open incidents).</p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" start="6">
            <li>Link the assignment set to the appropriate conditions. 
 Assignment sets are associated with conditions of the same object type 
 and they are reusable throughout the Assignment Tree.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">When complete, a set of territories and their corresponding conditions 
 are created. You can verify the territory association of customers in 
 List Manager. For instructions, see the <a href="OES_AAFAQ.htm">FAQ</a>.</p>
