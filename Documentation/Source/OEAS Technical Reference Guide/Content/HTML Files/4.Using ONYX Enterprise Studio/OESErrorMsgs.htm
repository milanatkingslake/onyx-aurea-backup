        <h3>Error messages </h3>
        <p>When you successfully save your changes in the administration and design 
 tools, all unsaved data indicators are removed and the success of the 
 process appears briefly in the browser status bar. If any part of the 
 save fails, a dialog box appears indicating which processes saved successfully 
 and which processes failed. </p>
        <p>If the save fails, the errors dialog box lists the reason for the failure. 
 However, the dialog can also indicate that the save was partially successful. 
 This is possible if you modified several items before saving your changes, 
 as it is possible that the other modifications saved successfully prior 
 to the save failing on the item indicated. For additional information 
 regarding partial saves, see <a href="OESSaveMod.htm">Saving modifications</a>.
