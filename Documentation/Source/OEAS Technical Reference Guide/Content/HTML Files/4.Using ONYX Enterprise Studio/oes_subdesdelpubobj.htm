        <h4>Deleting a publishable object </h4>
        <p>Use caution when deleting publishable objects and consider deactivating 
 objects rather than deleting them as there might be transactional data 
 that references the publishable object’s domain data. </p>
        <p class="Warning" MadCap:autonum=" &#160;&#160;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Onyx recommends that you not delete any of the default 
 publishable objects that are created during installation of OEAS.</p>
        <p>Use the following procedure to delete a publishable object. </p>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To delete a publishable object: </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>In the navigation area, locate and select the 
 publishable object that you want to delete.</li>
            <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconDelete0.jpg" /> to mark the publishable object 
 for deletion.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">The publishable object name appears with a strikethrough 
 font in the navigation area (for example: <span style="x-text-line-through: normal;text-decoration: line-through;">newPublishableObject</span>). 
 </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconSave0.jpg" /> to save your changes and 
 delete the publishable object.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="ListNote" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Deleting a publishable object that has already been published 
 does not delete the object’s data file from the publication directory. 
 That file will remain in the publication directory until deleted by the 
 administrator. </p>
        <p>If you have simply marked the publishable object for deletion and have 
 not yet saved the changes, you can still “undelete” the publishable object 
 by unmarking it for deletion. </p>
        <p>Use the following procedure to unmark a publishable object marked for 
 deletion. </p>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To unmark a publishable object marked for deletion: </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>In the navigation area, locate and select the 
 publishable object that you previously marked for deletion. It is distinguished 
 in the navigation area by the strikethrough font of its name.</li>
            <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconDelete0.jpg" /> to unmark the publishable 
 object for deletion.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">The strikethrough font is removed from the name, 
 and the publishable object is unmarked for deletion. </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconSave0.jpg" /> to save your changes.</li>
