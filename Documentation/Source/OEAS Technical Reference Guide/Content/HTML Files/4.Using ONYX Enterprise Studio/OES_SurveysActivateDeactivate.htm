        <h4>Making items available or unavailable </h4>
        <p>To make an item available to your users, you must make it active. To 
 make it unavailable, you either delete it or make it inactive. </p>
        <p>You cannot delete an item that is used by a survey without removing 
 it from any survey components that are using it, because doing so would 
 violate referential integrity in the database. Therefore, if you try to 
 delete an item that is used by a survey, you cannot save the change. </p>
        <p>Question responses are a special case: to delete a question response, 
 you use <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Delete</span><span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">  <![CDATA[ ]]></span>in the edit area of the question that the question response is 
 associated with. Because the question response is associated only with 
 that question, no other survey component is using the question response 
 when you delete it. If the question response is included in the survey’s 
 question hierarchy, however, the deletion will fail. </p>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To make an item active or inactive: </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>In the edit area for the item, check or uncheck 
 the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Active</span><span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">  <![CDATA[ ]]></span>box, as appropriate.</li>

            <li>To mark the item for deletion, on the toolbar, 
 click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconDelete0.jpg" />.</li>
