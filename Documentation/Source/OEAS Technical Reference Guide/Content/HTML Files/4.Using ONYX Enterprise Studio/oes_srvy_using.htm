        <h3>Using Survey Administration </h3>
        <p>To successfully work with surveys, it is important 
 to understand the following definitions of the components of a survey. 
 It is particularly important to understand the difference between questions 
 and survey questions, and between responses and question responses. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Survey type</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">A survey type is a grouping of surveys. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Survey</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">A survey is a collection of questions and the responses associated 
 with those questions, sometimes ordered by a question hierarchy. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Question</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">A question is a prompt whose purpose is to obtain information from 
 respondents. </p>
        <p class="Indent1">A question is not associated with a survey. Questions are listed 
 in the navigation area, under the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">All Questions 
 </span>node. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Survey question</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">A survey question is an instance of a question that is associated 
 with a survey. </p>
        <p class="Indent1">When you add a question to a survey, then you create a survey question. 
 If you create a question within a survey, you create both a survey question 
 and a question. </p>
        <p class="Indent1">Survey questions are listed within the survey with which they are 
 associated, under <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Survey Questions</span>. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Response</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">A response is a possible answer for a question. </p>
        <p class="Indent1">A response is not associated with a question. Responses are listed 
 in the navigation area, under the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">All Responses 
 </span>node. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Question response</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">A question response is an instance of a response that is associated 
 with a question. </p>
        <p class="Indent1">When you add a response to a question, then you create a question 
 response. If you create a response within a question, you create both 
 a response and a question response. Question responses are listed within 
 the question with which they are associated. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Question hierarchy</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">A question hierarchy is a structure that links question responses to 
 subsequent survey questions, thus determining which survey questions are 
 asked and in what order. </p>
