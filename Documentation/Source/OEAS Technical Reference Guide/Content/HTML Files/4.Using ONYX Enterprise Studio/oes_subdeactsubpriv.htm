        <h4>Deactivating and re-activating subscription profiles </h4>
        <p>You might choose to deactivate a subscription profile for users that 
 need to have their data synchronized, but do not need to explicitly subscribe 
 to data. For example, you might want to prevent a user from subscribing 
 to data, but you want to be sure that their changes are upsynced. Or, 
 custom logic might have been implemented that automatically subscribes 
 items to users, but the users themselves are not permitted to explicitly 
 subscribe to records. </p>
        <p>When you deactivate a subscription profile: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The user no longer has access to subscription 
 functionality within OEP.</li>
            <li>Advanced subscribers can no longer subscribe or 
 unsubscribe on behalf of the user whose profile was deactivated.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Clearing the selection of the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Profile Active</span> 
 attribute of the subscription profile has no effect on the user’s ability 
 to synchronize records to which they have previously subscribed. They 
 can continue to work with these records in the offline data store but 
 they are no longer able to explicitly subscribe to additional records. 
 </p>
        <p>Implicit subscriptions can still occur when: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The user creates a new record while working while 
 disconnected and synchronizes that record to OEP. </li>
            <li>A newly created record is a parent or child of 
 a record to which the user is already subscribed and an existing cascading 
 relationship automatically subscribes the user to the new record.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To deactivate subscription for the subscription profile: </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>In the Security Administration navigation area, 
 select the subscription profile.</li>
            <li>In the edit area, uncheck the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Profile 
 Active</span> box.</li>
            <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconSave0.jpg" /> on the toolbar to save your 
 change. </li>
            <li>Stop and restart the OEP Web site.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">When the user next logs on, the subscription controls 
 in OEP are no longer available. </p>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To re-activate subscription for the subscription profile: </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>In the Security Administration navigation area,

            <li>In the edit area, make sure that the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Profile
