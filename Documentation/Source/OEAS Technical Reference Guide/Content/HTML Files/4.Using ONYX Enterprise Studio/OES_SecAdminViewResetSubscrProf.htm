        <h5>Viewing and refreshing a subscription profile’s subscription rules 
 </h5>
        <p>The subscription rules table in the edit area for a subscription profile 
 summarizes the relationships between subscribable objects and the rules 
 regarding automatic subscription. Click <span style="font-weight: bold;">View 
 Subscription Rules</span> to view subscription rules for a particular 
 profile. </p>
        <p>The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Relationship </span>column contains the description 
 of the <em class="Emphasis">subscription relationship</em> between two subscribable 
 objects, such as “Company ID of the individual” or “Company owner of an 
 incident.” A subscription relationship<em class="Emphasis">  <![CDATA[ ]]></em>between 
 a primary object and a secondary object creates a subscription to one 
 of the objects for a user when he or she subscribes to the other. Whether 
 the subscription is for the primary object as a consequence of the user’s 
 subscribing to the secondary object or vice versa depends on the following 
 rules. </p>
        <p>Under the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Primary Object</span> 
 heading for the relationship: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Required? </span>column 
 indicates whether, in Subscription Designer, the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Always 
 subscribe the primary object (and unsubscribe the secondary object when 
 the primary object is unsubscribed)</span> rule is specified for the primary 
 object in the relationship. If set by the administrator, this subscription-relationship 
 rule specifies that: </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Sec_List">When a user subscribes to the secondary object, 
 the user is also subscribed to the primary object. If there is another 
 required relationship defined for the primary object, the user is also 
 subscribed to the object in that required relationship and so on, until 
 the end of the chain of required relationships is reached.</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">Unsubscribing from the primary object also 
 unsubscribes the user from the secondary object.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Cascade? </span>column 
 indicates whether the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Subscribe primary object and 
 cascade its subscription relationships </span>rule is specified in Subscription 
 Designer for the primary object in the relationship. This subscription-relationship 
 rule specifies that when a user subscribes to the secondary object in 
 the relationship: </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Sec_List">The user is automatically subscribed to the 
 primary object in the relationship. </li>
            <li class="Sec_List">If the primary object has subscription-relationship 
 rules that cascade subscription to other objects, those rules are carried 
 out as a result of this initial subscription.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Under the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Secondary Object</span> 
 heading for the relationship: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Cascade? </span>column 
 indicates whether the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Subscribe secondary object 
 and cascade its subscription relationships </span>rule is specified in 
 Subscription Designer for the primary object in the relationship. This 
 subscription-relationship rule specifies that when a subscriber subscribes 
 to the primary object in the relationship, automatic cascaded subscriptions 
 are created for that subscriber for the secondary objects in the relationship. 
 If the secondary object has subscription-relationship rules that cascade 
 subscription to other objects, those rules are carried out as a result 
 of this initial subscription. This chain continues until the end of the 
 chain of relationships is reached.</li>
            <li>The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Filter </span>column 
 displays any filter that has been created in Subscription Designer for 
 limiting the secondary objects with which a cascading relationship to 
 the primary object in the relationship is created.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To view or refresh a profile’s subscription rules: </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>In the edit area for the user’s subscription profile, 
 click <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">View Subscription Rules</span>.</li>
