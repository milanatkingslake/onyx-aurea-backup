        <h4>About resource groups </h4>
        <p>Three resource groups, which are under <span style="font-weight: bold;">Resources</span> 
 in the navigation area, organize all the resources managed by Security 
 Administration. You cannot create new resource groups, but you can create 
 new resources within these groups. When you add a new resource, the sa 
 user automatically has access permission for the new resource. </p>
        <p>The three resource groups are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Business Objects 
 -</b> These resources represent the objects that are created and modified 
 in the Object Designer. You cannot grant or deny access permissions for 
 them; you can do so only for their methods, which are listed under them 
 in the navigation area. Only the methods listed under the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Business 
 Objects </span>resource node are unsecured by default. (The entities listed 
 under the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">UI Resources</span> node and 
 the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Other Resources</span> node are 
 resources by default and do not need to be secured.) </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">To secure a business object method as a resource, see <a href="OES_SecAdminBusObRes.htm">Administering 
 Business Object resources</a>. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">UI Resources -</b> This group represents 
 any user interface, in the OES tools and OEP. With these resources, you 
 can specify access permissions for specific areas of a user interface 
 or for the entire user interface.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ListNote" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">You can specify permissions for an individual action 
 (method) that can be carried out in a UI resource by specifying permissions 
 for the corresponding object.method under Business Objects. Or you can 
 specify access to a portion of a UI resource by creating a custom resource 
 under Other Resources. However, changing access permissions for object.methods 
 for UI resources can affect the functionality of dependent products such 
 as the Onyx Enterprise Studio and the Onyx Employee Portal. Before you 
 implement such changes in a production environment, test them with OEAS. 
 Publish your modifications only when you are certain that you want them 
 to be implemented in the production environment.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Other Resources -</b> This group 
 includes customer-defined (custom) resources, which you can add or delete. 
 You can create resources that represent an object, a method, or a piece 
 of data. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ListNote" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Resource attributes are cached each time the COM+ application 
 OnyxEASApp starts. Therefore, if you add or delete a resource or change 
 its attributes (apart from user-access permissions) while OnyxEASApp is 
 running, the changes do not take effect until you shut down and restart 
 OnyxEASApp. </p>
