        <h4>Working with question hierarchies </h4>
        <p>Question hierarchies add structure to surveys by defining which survey 
 question follows another. Using question hierarchies, you can create different 
 branches in the survey. In the example given in Surveys, the question 
 hierarchy splits the survey according to whether customers use Product 
 A or Product B. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Any survey questions for which you don’t define a question 
 hierarchy appear in the survey in the same order that they appear under 
 the survey in the navigation area. </p>
        <p>Question hierarchies can include free-text questions and questions that 
 have multiple responses. For questions with multiple responses and for 
 free-text questions, Survey Administration automatically specifies “(all 
 responses)” in the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Response</span><span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">  <![CDATA[ ]]></span>box. The survey question that you select as the 
 next question is the next question regardless of the respondent’s answer.
