        <h4>Filtering secondary object cascaded subscriptions </h4>
        <p>You can set the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Cascade only the secondary objects 
 that meet this filter expression</span> rule for a subscription relationship 
 at both the relationship level and the role level, as described in <a href="OES_SubDeAddSubRel.htm">Adding a subscription relationship</a>, 
 and <a href="OES_SubDesAddSubRol.htm">Adding a subscription role</a>. 
 To set this rule, you can either manually type the filter expression into 
 the provided text field, or use the filter helper menu to select an appropriate 
 filter expression. </p>
        <h5>Adding a filter criteria manually </h5>
        <p>The text you provide for the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Cascade 
 only the secondary objects that meet this filter expression</span> field 
 is the expression that is used to filter cascaded subscriptions for the 
 secondary object in the relationship. The expression must be in the following 
 format: <span class="code">child.&lt;field&gt;&lt;SQL operator&gt;&lt;value&gt;</span>, 
 where: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em class="Emphasis" style="font-style: italic;">child.</em> represents 
 the secondary object in the relationship and includes the literal text 
 "child."; must be placed at the beginning of your expression. 
 </li>
            <li><em class="Emphasis" style="font-style: italic;">&lt;field&gt; </em>represents the 
 column of the database table (which contains the secondary object) on 
 which you want to filter the cascaded subscriptions. </li>
            <li><em class="Emphasis" style="font-style: italic;">&lt;SQL operator&gt;</em> 
 represents a valid SQL comparison or character operator (for example, 
 <span class="code">=</span>, <span class="code">&lt;</span>, <span class="code">&lt;&gt;</span>, 
 <span class="code">&lt;=</span>, etc., or <span class="code">BETWEEN</span>, 
 <span class="code">IN</span>, <span class="code">LIKE</span>, <span class="code">NOT 
 IN</span>, etc.).</li>
            <li><em class="Emphasis" style="font-style: italic;">&lt;value&gt; </em>represents the 
 value you want to filter on.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For instance, suppose you provide the expression child.incident_category_did=1 
 for a relationship where company is the primary object and incident is 
 the secondary object. When a company object is subscribed to, cascaded 
 subscriptions are created only for those incidents where incident_category_did=1 
 (support incidents). </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">There is no validation performed on filter expressions. 
 If you provide an expression that is not valid SQL, or that references 
 a field that does not exist in the secondary object’s underlying database 
 table, the filter expression could be disregarded, or cascading subscriptions 
 for that relationship could fail altogether. </p>
        <h5>Adding a filter criteria using the filter helper menu </h5>
        <p>A filter helper menu button, <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_MethodCallDetPathHelper.jpg" />, appears to the right of 
 the text field for the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Cascade only the secondary 
 objects that meet this filter expression</span> attribute. When you click 
 this button, a filter helper menu appears from which you can select an 
 appropriate filter for cascading secondary object subscriptions. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The filter helper menu is enabled only for those relationships 
 for which a default filter expression exists. To add a default filter 
 expression to the filter helper menu, see <a href="../3.Configuring OEAS Features/AR_SubConfigFilters.htm">Configuring filters for Subscription Designer’s filter helper menu</a>. </p>
