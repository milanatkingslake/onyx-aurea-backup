        <h5>Adding a subscribable object </h5>
        <p>Use the following procedure to add a subscribable object. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">All objects that are supported in OEP-Offline are created 
 as subscribable when OEAS is installed, however when you add a new subscribable 
 object with Subscription Designer, you are completing only part of the 
 process of adding a new object to OEP-Offline.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To add a subscribable object: </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>In the navigation area, within the appropriate 
 subscription service node to which you want to add a subscribable object, 
 select the Subscribable Objects node.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Subscribable Objects</span> 
 view appears in the edit area. </p>
        <p class="Warning" MadCap:autonum=" &#160;&#160;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">While this tool enables you to make reminder, workNoteHeader, 
 and workNoteDetail objects subscribable objects, Onyx does not recommend 
 doing so. These objects, along with the workNote object, contain hard-coded 
 relationships that already provide correct cascading subscription behavior. 
 In addition, Onyx does not recommend modifying the default subscription 
 relationships provided for forecast and quote objects. Failure to heed 
 these recommendations can cause duplicate data in OEDB.</p>
        <ol start="2" style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>In the edit area, select the OEAS business object 
 that you want to add as a subscribable object. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The list of available objects contains only those 
 transactional objects in the OED that have not yet been made subscribable. </p>
        <ol start="3" style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>Click <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Make Subscribable</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">A new subscribable object (with the same name as 
 the original OEAS business object) appears in the navigation area followed 
 by an asterisk (*). </p>
        <ol start="3" style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>In the edit area, define the attributes for the 
 subscribable object.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Object -</b> This is the name of 
 the object that you selected to make subscribable. You can change your 
 selection from the provided list of available objects, which again only 
 includes those objects that exist in the OED that have not yet been made 
 subscribable. </p>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Object Type -</b> The object type 
 is not editable as it reflects the object type value for the underlying 
 OEAS business object, as defined within the OED. </p>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Top-Level Object -</b> This attribute 
 identifies a top-level object. An object identified as a top-level object 
 is recognized by the cascade process as an object that requires no further 
 upward cascaded subscriptions as it is not considered a secondary object 
 to any other objects. </p>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Collision Handler ProgID -</b> The 
 Collision Handler ProgID identifies the collision handler you want to 
 use for the subscribable object. OnyxCollisionHandler.CollisionHandler 
 is the Prog ID of the collision handler that is provided with OEP-Offline. 
 It is a registered COM component. The Collision Handler ProgID can be 
 a maximum of 255 characters. For information about customizing the collision 
 handler, see <a href="../7.OEAS Developers Reference/c_script_control_type_add_new.htm">Add custom collision handling</a>. If 
 a Collision Handler ProgID is not specified, no collision handling is 
 performed (no collisions are automatically resolved) and all collisions 
 are reported to the offline user. </p>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Extra Data XML -</b> The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Extra 
 Data XML</span> attribute supports the subscribableObject metadata. It 
 contains well-formed XML that includes the data passed into the extraData 
 node of the CollisionHandler and the data passed into the extraData node 
 of the sync subsystem. The Extra Data XML can be an unlimited number of 
 characters. For more information about this attribute, see <a href="OES_SubDesExtraDataXML.htm">Understanding 
 Extra Data XML</a>. </p>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Active -</b> The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Active</span> 
 attribute controls whether or not the subscribable object is available 
 for subscription. </p>
        <ol start="3" style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconSave0.jpg" /> to save your changes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">After you have added a new subscribable object, you can add 
 subscription relationships to enforce appropriate cascaded subscriptions 
 of related objects. For more information, see <a href="OES_SubDesDefSubRel.htm">Defining 
 subscription relationships </a>. </p>
