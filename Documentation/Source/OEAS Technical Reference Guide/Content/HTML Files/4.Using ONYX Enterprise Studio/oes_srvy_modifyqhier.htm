        <h5>Modifying question hierarchies </h5>
        <p>You change the structure of question hierarchies by removing and/or 
 adding links between question responses and next-questions. </p>
        <p>For example, to remove the multiple-answer survey 
 question “What features would you like to see in Product A?” from the 
 sample question hierarchy (see <a href="../2.OEAS Features/ar_ca_srvy_usesrvyexample.htm">Using 
 surveys: an example</a>), you would: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove the link between the previous survey question’s 
 responses “Centrally” and “In multiple locations” and the multiple-answer 
 survey question “What features would you like to see in Product A?”.</li>
            <li>For the survey question “What features would you 
 like to see in Product A?”, remove the link question response “(all responses)” 
 and the next survey question in the hierarchy, “In which markets do you 
 use Product A?”</li>
            <li>Add a link between the question responses “Centrally” 
 and “In multiple locations” and the survey question “In which markets 
 do you use Product A?”</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">To add the new link, use the same procedure with which you originally 
 created the links. </p>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To remove a link between a question response and the next survey 
 question in the question hierarchy: </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>Under <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Hierarchy 
 summary</span><span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">, </span>select the link that you 
 want to break.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Remove Link</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">In the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Hierarchy 
 Summary</span>, the link description is crossed out. </p>
