        <h5>Renaming an object or method </h5>
        <p>In Object Designer, it is possible to change an object or method name; 
 however, doing so has the following consequences related to Security Administration: 
 </p>
        <p>Consequences of renaming an object: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The old object name no longer appears in the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Business Objects</span> resource list; the 
 new object name now appears representing the renamed object. </li>
            <li>The methods on the renamed object become unsecured.</li>
            <li>The object method’s new &lt;object.method&gt; 
 name is the basis for the resource's resource ID, when the method is again 
 secured. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Consequences of renaming a method: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The renamed method becomes an unsecured method.</li>
            <li>If the method was previously secured, an entry 
 with the old resource ID remains in the OEDB resource table, but is no 
 longer valid.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Warning" MadCap:autonum=" &#160;&#160;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Onyx recommends that you not rename any Onyx-supplied 
 objects or methods, because doing so breaks any user interface that uses 
 OEAS, such as Onyx Employee Portal. More consequences of changing object.method 
 names in Object Designer follow this&#160;warning.</p>
        <p>Similarly, in Object Designer, it is possible to delete 
 an Onyx-supplied object or method, but Onyx also recommends that you not 
 do this, because of the following results: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The deletion of an Onyx-supplied object or method 
 breaks any user interface that uses the method.</li>
            <li>If the resource that represented the deleted object.method 
 was secured, an entry with the old resource ID remains in the OEDB resource 
 table, but is no longer valid.</li>
        </ul>
