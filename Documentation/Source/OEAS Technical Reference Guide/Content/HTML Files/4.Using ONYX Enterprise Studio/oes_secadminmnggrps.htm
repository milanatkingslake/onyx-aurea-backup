        <h3>Managing groups </h3>
        <p>In Security Administration, groups are an organizationally based collection 
 of users. Groups can be nested within groups. However, a user can be a 
 member of only one group. &#160;</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">There is no functionality to delete a group, you must deactivate 
 it. See <a href="OES_SecAdminDelGroup.htm">Activating or deactivating 
 a group</a> for further details.</p>
        <p>The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Users</span> node that appears within 
 the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Groups</span> node is created by 
 default and is actually not a group, it is a container area for users 
 (Onyx user accounts) who are members of this group. In order to make changes 
 to a user, you must open the group that the user is a member of and select 
 the user. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">You cannot add groups to resources or grant or deny them 
 access permissions to resources, and you cannot add groups to roles. </p>
        <p>Managing groups involves the following tasks: </p>
