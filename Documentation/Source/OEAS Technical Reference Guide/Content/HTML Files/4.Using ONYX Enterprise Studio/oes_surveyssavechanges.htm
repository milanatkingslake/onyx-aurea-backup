        <h4>Saving changes </h4>
        <p>Changes that you make are not effected until you save them. When you 
 close Survey Administration, any changes made since the last save operation 
 are lost. When you close Survey Administration, you are prompted to save 
 any unsaved changes before closing. </p>
        <p>When changes to an item have not been saved, the itemâ€™s name in the 
 navigation area is followed by an asterisk. </p>
        <p>If there are any changes that the Survey Administration tool cannot 
 save, a message appears, explaining which changes it saved and which it 
 could not save. Typically, such problems occur when an item that is associated 
 with a survey is marked for deletion. For instance, by adding a question 
 to a survey, you create a survey question that is 1) associated with that 
 survey and 2) an instance of the question that you added to the survey. 
 If you try to save changes that include deleting the question from the 
 <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">All Questions</span> node in the navigation 
 area, the following message appears. </p>
