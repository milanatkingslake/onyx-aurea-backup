        <h3>Managing resources</h3>
        <p>You can grant users the permission to use certain OEP features either 
 by assigning them to one or more roles, or by granting them access to 
 specific resources, or both.</p>
        <p>Resources define distinct areas of functionality to which access can 
 be granted or restricted. Most resources listed in OES Security Administration 
 pertain to OEP, but resources exist for other Onyx products (such as OES and 
 OPS) as well. A resource also exists for each object.method 
 in OEAS, regardless of which application uses it.</p>
        <p>Using Security Administration, you can grant or deny 
 access to various types of resources:</p>
        <ul class="hcp2" style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li><span class="hcp1" style="font-weight: bold;">Business Objects:</span> 
 You can set access permissions to OEAS business objects in order to permit 
 or deny users from performing certain actions (or methods) on OEAS. For 
 instance, by denying users permission to the address.saveCollection method, 
 users cannot save addresses to the OEDB regardless of whether they're 
 using OEP or any other UI that uses address.saveCollection.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">By default, all users have permission to 
 access all business objects, unless otherwise restricted by a role to 
 which they are assigned.</p>
        <ul class="hcp2" style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li><span class="hcp1" style="font-weight: bold;">Other Resources:</span> 
 You can set access permissions to miscellaneous other resources and customizations, 
 such as to Cognos and the Onyx Process Manager.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">By default, all users have permission to 
 access Cognos, unless otherwise restricted by a role to which they are 
 assigned.</p>
        <p class="Indent1">By default, no users have permission to 
 access Onyx Process Manager, and all default roles have permission to 
 access Cognos.</p>
        <ul class="hcp2" style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li><span class="hcp1" style="font-weight: bold;">UI Resources:</span> 
 You can set access permissions to various user interfaces, such as to 
 Onyx Processing Server (OPS) and to 
 each tool of OES, as well as to distinct OEP functionality. For instance, 
 by denying users permission to the UI:OEP.company.update resource, users 
 cannot update OEP company records.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">By default, only the Administrator role 
 has permission to access OES tools, and all default roles have permission 
 to OEP UI resources. For details about OEP security resources, see </p>
