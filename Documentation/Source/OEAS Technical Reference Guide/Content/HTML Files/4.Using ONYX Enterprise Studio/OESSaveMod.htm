        <h3>Saving modifications </h3>
        <p>In the OES tools, you can make multiple modifications before saving 
 your changes. Onyx recommends that you save your work on a frequent basis 
 to avoid data loss due to potential network interruptions or other system 
 failures. </p>
        <p>In addition, when you save changes within any given tool, it can involve 
 more than one object and can also involve more than one call to the Onyx 
 Transaction Manager (OTM). As a result, if you have modified several items 
 within a tool, there can be several different areas where the save can 
 fail, although other items that used a different object or a separate 
 call to the OTM can succeed. If a save failure occurs, none of the objects 
 of the same type are saved, and the unsaved data indicators in the tool 
 (asterisks) remain. Other object types might still save successfully if 
 they are processed before the failing item. &#160;In 
 addition, delete operations are usually processed first and can succeed 
 even though updates or inserts have failed for the same object. </p>
        <p>The outcome of a save can be further complicated by the hierarchy of 
 the objects involved in the save and the order in which the save is designed 
 to perform. For example, in Product Administration, product deletes are 
 processed first, then product group inserts, updates, and deletes, then 
 product inserts and updates. This design enables the user to delete (or 
 insert) all products from a group and the group itself, and only have 
 to save their changes once. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The process for saving items in a design tool is similar 
 to that of the administration tools but in some cases also involves publishing 
 those changes to OEAS. Review the documented Help for each design tool 
 for specific details. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To save your changes: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconSave0.jpg" /> to save changes to the Onyx 
 Enterprise Database (OEDB).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">All strike-through names and asterisks disappear when items are 
 successfully saved to the&#160;database. </p>
        <p class="ListNote" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">You cannot undo a save. Verify that you have not made 
 any accidental or undesired changes before proceeding. </p>
