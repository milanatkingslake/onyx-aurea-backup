        <h4>Working with variables </h4>
        <p>You must define a variable before it appears in the 
 <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Edit Step</span> area, although not before using 
 it in a rule or in text merging. You can use either of two Web Page Dialogs 
 to define a variable: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Variables Web Page Dialog</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Method Call Binding Builder 
 Web Page Dialog</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">The Method Call Binding Builder is recommended for creating variables 
 that you will use with method calls. For information on using the Method 
 Call Binding Builder, see <a href="OES_ScriptMethodCall.htm">Working with 
 method calls</a>. </p>
        <p>Part of the definition of a variable is its scope. For script variables, 
 “scope” refers to whether it is available to a single step (“step-local” 
 scope) within a script or to all the steps in the script (“global” scope). 
 </p>
        <p>No two variables in the same script can have the same name, even if 
 the scope of one is step-local and of the other is global. </p>
        <p>If you rename a variable, you must manually change each occurrence of 
 it in the script, whether in a rule, header, footer, prompt, or method 
 call binding. </p>
        <p>Context variables are created automatically, and cannot be defined, 
 renamed, or deleted. For more information on context variables, including 
 their names, see <i>Variables</i>. </p>
