        <h5>Deleting a method call detail </h5>
        <p>After you mark a method call for deletion and save your changes, you 
 cannot undo the deletion. </p>
        <p>You cannot delete a method call detail if that method call detail is 
 being referenced by a script. You must remove the association between 
 the method call detail and the script before you can delete the method 
 call detail. To remove the association, either delete the script item 
 that references the method call detail, or reference a new method call 
 detail to that item. </p>
        <p>You can delete a method call detail belonging to a 
 method call that is being used by a merge template, but you must then 
 also update the merge template to use another method call or method call 
 detail. Until you update the merge template: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the deleted method call detail was an output, 
 a raw output tag appears in the merge template text, because no field 
 exists to merge. </li>
            <li>If the deleted method call detail was an input, 
 an error occurs when a user tries to execute the merge template. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also choose to deactivate the method call detail rather than 
 deleting it, as described in <a href="OES_MethCallActMethCallDet.htm">Activating 
 or deactivating a method call detail</a>. </p>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To delete a method call detail: </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>In the navigation area, select the method call 
 detail that you want to delete.</li>
            <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconDelete0.jpg" /> to mark the method call detail 
 for deletion.</li>
            <p>The method call detail name appears struck through 
 in the navigation area (for example: <span style="x-text-line-through: normal;text-decoration: line-through;">newMethodCallDetail</span>). 
 </p>
            <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconSave0.jpg" /> to save your changes and 
 delete the method call detail.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you have marked the method call detail for deletion and have not 
 yet saved the changes, you can still remove the mark for deletion. </p>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To remove a mark for deletion from a method call detail: </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>In the navigation area, select the method call 
 detail that you previously marked for deletion. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">Method call details that are marked for deletion 
 appear struck through in the navigation area. </p>
