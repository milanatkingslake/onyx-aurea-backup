        <h3>Planning the script</h3>
        <p>Although the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Edit Layout</span> area acts as a 
 storyboard, planning your script before creating it rewards you with a 
 speedier process and fewer problems when you create it. When you plan 
 a script, consider the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The script end-user’s starting point with the 
 customer</li>
            <li>Possible end points of the script</li>
            <li>Rules that define the user’s possible paths on 
 the way to those end points</li>
            <li>Conditions (logical expressions that are evaluated 
 to true or false) that those rules use to decide between branches</li>
            <li>Prompts and responses for each step, including 
 whether each prompt should be required</li>
            <li>Variables needed for use in condition statements, 
 to merge text, to pass values to method calls, and to store values returned 
 by method calls</li>
            <li>Desired scope of variables: whether the variable 
 should be available to more than one step in the script and whether the 
 user will want its value to be preserved when using Quick Edit</li>
            <li>Method calls needed for the script to gather, 
 modify, and/or disseminate data</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Sec_List">The points in the script that require data 
 obtained from method calls, that use method calls to update the database, 
 or that use method calls to perform other actions, such as creating and 
 sending an email message</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">Which data needs to be passed to method calls</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">Which data the method calls should insert 
 into, update, or retrieve from the database</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Quick Edit—whether the end-user should be able 
 to return to a step and change the data in the responses without re-evaluation 
 of the rules.</li>
        </ul>
