        <h5>Creating editable responses </h5>
        <p>An editable response presents an answer for the respondent to select, 
 but also allows the respondent to supply his or her own answer. </p>
        <p>A typical use of an editable response is to let the respondent specify 
 some other response than the set of responses available for a question. 
 For instance, in the survey example described in Using surveys: an example 
 we ask GlobalTechnologies’ customers, “What features would you like to 
 see added to Product (A)(B)?” Among the possible responses to this question, 
 we provide “Other” and make the response editable. This allows respondents 
 to describe a desired feature that is not included in the question’s available 
 responses. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">You can also create free-text questions, in which the respondent 
 writes his or her answer in its entirety. For information on creating 
 a free-text question, see <a href="OES_SurveysWorkingWithQuestions.htm">Working 
 with questions</a>. </p>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To make a response editable: </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>In the navigation area, under <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">All 
 Responses</span>, select the response.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2" style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li><span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: normal;">Check the</span><span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;"> Editable</span> box.</li>
