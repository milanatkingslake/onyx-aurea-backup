        <h4>Administering Business Object resources </h4>
        <p>A method listed under a business object is not (by default) a resource 
 until it has been secured as a resource in Security Administration. Note 
 that it is only necessary to secure those methods that you need to manage 
 permissions for, such as restricting a user’s access to certain methods. 
 The methods that are unsecured appear in italics; after they are secured, 
 the font is not italicized. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Only the methods listed under the Business Objects resource 
 node are unsecured by default. The entities listed under the UI Resources 
 node and the Other Resources node are resources by default and do not 
 need to be secured. </p>
