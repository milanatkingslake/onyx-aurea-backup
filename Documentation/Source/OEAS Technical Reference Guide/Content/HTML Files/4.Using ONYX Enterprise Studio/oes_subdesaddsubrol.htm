        <h5>Adding a subscription role </h5>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To add a subscription role: </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>In the navigation area, navigate to and expand 
 the appropriate subscription relationship to which you want to add a subscription 
 role and click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconAdd0.jpg" />. Or, you can select an existing subscription 
 role of the subscription relationship and click <img src="../../Resources/Images/oes_iconAdd0.jpg" />.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">A new subscription role named <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">newRole</span>&lt;n&gt; 
 appears in the navigation area followed by an asterisk (*). </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>In the edit area, define the attributes for the 
 subscription role.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">ID </b>- The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">ID</span> 
 attribute is not editable as it is a primary key field. This attribute 
 is a unique application-defined identification number given to each subscription 
 role created. </p>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Role -</b> This is the OEAS organizational 
 role that you select to assign to the subscription role. In the Subscription 
 Designer, you select this value from a list of all active OEAS roles. 
 </p>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Name -</b> This attribute is the 
 user-friendly name you provide for the subscription role. There is no 
 requirement for the name to have any particular relation to the underlying 
 OEAS organizational role. The name can be a maximum of 50 characters. 
 </p>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Description -</b> The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span> 
 attribute is the brief description of the subscription role that you provide. 
 The description can be a maximum of 255 characters. </p>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Active -</b> The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Active</span> 
 attribute controls whether or not the subscription role is recognized 
 by the cascade process so that any rules associated with it can be used 
 to cascade related objects for the members of that role. </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Define the rules for the subscription role. These 
 rules define automatic (cascading) subscription, unsubscription, and deletion 
 behavior between the primary and secondary objects in a relationship for 
 members of the role. For more information about the impact of these rules, 
 see <a href="../2.OEAS Features/AR_CA_SubscRelatRules.htm">Subscription relationships, rules, and roles.</a></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Subscribe primary object and cascade 
 its subscription relationships -</b> Selecting this attribute for the 
 subscription role ensures that when a member of the role subscribes to 
 the secondary object in the relationship, automatic cascaded subscriptions 
 are created for that subscriber to the primary object in the relationship. 
 </p>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Subscribe secondary object and cascade 
 its subscription relationships -</b> Selecting this attribute for the 
 subscription role ensures that when a member of the role subscribes to 
 the primary object in the relationship, automatic cascaded subscriptions 
 are created for that subscriber to the secondary objects in the relationship. 
 </p>
        <p class="Indent1"><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Cascade only the secondary objects 
 that meet this filter expression -</b> This attribute contains a SQL expression 
 used in a WHERE clause that limits the automatically subscribed secondary 
 object instances. Providing a filter expression for this attribute of 
 the subscription role ensures that when a member of that role subscribes 
 to the primary object in the relationship, automatic cascaded subscriptions 
 are created for that subscriber to only the secondary objects in the relationship 
 that meet the filter expression. This rule can only be set if you have 
 enabled the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Subscribe secondary object and cascade 
 its subscription relationships </span>rule. This attribute can be a maximum 
 of 500 characters. </p>
        <p class="ListNote" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The filter expression must be valid SQL. Invalid SQL 
 can cause cascades involving this relationship to fail. For information 
 about creating an appropriate filter expression, see <a href="OES_SubDesFiltering.htm">Filtering 
 secondary object cascaded subscriptions</a>. </p>
