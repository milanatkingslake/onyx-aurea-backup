        <h1>What is OEAS? </h1>
        <p>OEAS is known as a middle-tier — or business services tier — application, 
 and is best explained in terms of the Microsoft Windows Distributed 
 interNet Applications (Windows DNA) development model for the Microsoft 
 Windows platform. Windows DNA is a n-tier model that is comprised of presentation, 
 business services, and data services tiers. The term Onyx Enterprise Application 
 Server refers to the Onyx components that reside in the business services 
 tier of the Windows DNA development model. All of these are used to communicate 
 with Onyx Enterprise Database, which resides in the data services tier. 
 </p>
        <p>Because OEAS is data-driven, the data that you store in the data services 
 tier (the Onyx Enterprise Database and the Onyx Enterprise Dictionary) 
 dictates the way OEAS behaves. Configuring and customizing this data changes 
 the way in which OEAS functions depending 
 on the modifications that you make. </p>
        <p>The following illustration depicts Onyx Internet Architecture from the 
 perspective of Windows DNA.

        </p>
        <p>OEAS exposes a COM+ based (component object model-based) application 
 programming interface (API) for accessing its core components (see <a href="../3.What are OEAS Core Components/AR_CA_WhatOEASCoreComponents.htm">What are OEAS core components?</a>) 
 and business objects (see <a href="../AR_CA_WhatOEASBusObjects.htm">What 
 are OEAS business objects?</a>), all of which run within a single COM+ 
 application. In addition, OEAS provides a HTTP/SOAP-based web service 
 API using Onyx Web Services.</p>
        <p>The OEAS core components serve as the engine for the business objects 
 and, together with the business objects, they provide a framework that 
 enables you to customize OEAS extensively. You can create custom user 
 interfaces to the OEAS platform, integrate OEAS with other enterprise 
 applications, and implement custom business rules for managing and storing 
 customer data. </p>
