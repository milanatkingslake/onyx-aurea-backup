        <h2>Configuring Domain Data </h2>
        <p>You can configure and administer OEAS domain data using the Onyx Enterprise 
 Studio (OES) administration tools or another client tool such as LBO 
 Tester. The following table is a partial list of OEAS domain data 
 which lists the type of data and the tool you can use to administer the 
 data. </p>
        <p>Typical activities you perform using the administration tools 
 include adding, deleting, and modifying items. For an overview of each 
 administrative tool, see <i>What is the 
 Onyx Enterprise Studio?</i>. </p>

        <p>You generally administer domain data with a feature-specific tool of 
 the Onyx Enterprise Studio (OES). For example, tracking codes and tracking code 
 types form the domain data for the Campaigns feature, and are administered with Campaign 
 Administration. Users, groups, and resources form the domain data for the 
 Security feature, and are administered with Security Administration. </p>
        <p>The following tools however enable you to administer domain data for a range of features:</p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Product Administration.</b> Products, 
 literature products, and incident products are domain data for three separate 
 feature areas (Customer Product, Literature Orders, and Incidents). Instead 
 of administering the domain data for each of these within a feature specific 
 administration tool, one tool, Product Administration, is provided to 
 administer the three different kinds of domain data. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Table Administration.</b>Table Administration 
 provides access to several areas of local domain data. Because of the 
 simplicity of the administration tasks associated with these areas of 
 domain data, no specific administration tool is provided. Rather, the 
 functionality for administering the data is provided with this single 
 administration tool. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Reference Table Administration.</b>
 Reference Table Administration is a tool that enables you to configure 
 reference field data in the Onyx Enterprise Database (OEDB). Depending 
 on the field type selected, you can configure field attributes such as 
 caption, field type, and lookup values for the field. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">System Parameter Administration.</b>
 System Parameter Administration is a tool that enables the editing of 
 system parameters. You use system parameters to control the behavior of 
 several features of the Onyx Enterprise Application Server (OEAS), including 
 how features are presented to users of the Onyx Employee Portal (OEP) 
 Web client. </p>
