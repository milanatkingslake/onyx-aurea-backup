        <h1>What are OEAS Business Objects? </h1>
        <p>OEAS includes many features, each represented by one or more business 
 objects defined in the OED. The business objects representing each feature 
 enable you to perform activities that pertain to customer relationship 
 management, such as saving customer data to your database, monitoring 
 your sales cycle and your relationship with your customers, and tracking 
 the incidents and requests generated by interactions with your customers. 
 </p>
        <p>The core components use the OED and the OEDB to provide the implementation 
 of the business objects. </p>
        <p>The following table explains the relationship between the business objects 
 and the core components. </p>
        <table style="width: 100%;">
            <col style="width: 130px;" />
            <col />
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Core Component</th>
                    <th>Relation to Business Objects</th>
                </tr>

                        <p class="Table_Text" style="color: #000000;">OTM receives requests from calling clients 
 to perform methods on business objects. The OTM references the OED to 
 obtain the definitions for these business objects, including their methods 
 and steps. Only after the OTM obtains the definition of a business object 
 can it begin to process the request. </p>
                        <p class="Table_Text" style="color: #000000;">When customizing OEAS, you can create your 
 own step components and business objects to modify existing behavior.

                        <p class="Table_Text">ODM is the step component required for any 
 method that uses SQLGen to communicate with OEDB. It generates SQL statements 
 based on information passed by the OTM. The ODM sends commands to the 
 Query Engine and receives results in return. It composes results from 
 the Query Engine into XML in the format required by OEAS and passes that 
 XML back to the OTM. As part of its processing the ODM also performs data 
 management functions, for example, generation of unique ID values when 
 required. </p>

 the metadata, a description of data, associated with that object. OED 
 includes physical model information about OEDB, including tables, columns, 
 procedures, and functions in it, as well as mapping information from the 
 logical to the physical model. </p>
                        <p class="Table_Text" style="color: #000000;">When creating a new business object for OEAS, 
 you first need to use the <a href="../7.OEAS Developers Reference/Object_Designer_Help.htm">Object 
 Designer</a> to define that object in the OED. You then use Onyx step 
 components or implement step components of your own, that encapsulate 
 the functionality for that business object.&#160; </p>
