        <h4>Processing Collisions </h4>
        <p>The Collision Handler is the mechanism for determining which of two 
 conflicting versions of a record is upsynced, or <em class="Emphasis">wins</em>, 
 so that the sync subsystem or OEP-Offline client can finish processing 
 the collision. </p>
        <p>To tailor the resolution of collisions to your business needs, the Collision 
 Handler can be configured for each type of business object that users 
 can subscribe to. In addition, it is possible to create custom collision 
 processing. For more information about the Collision Handler and custom 
 collision processing, see <a href="../../7.OEAS Developers Reference/custom_collision_handler.htm">Add custom collision handling</a> in the OEAS Developerâ€™s Reference. </p>
        <p>When processing collisions, the Collision Handler 
 takes one of the following actions: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Collision Handler attempts to resolve the 
 collision automatically by applying <em class="Emphasis">collision-resolution 
 algorithms</em> (rules that specify which of two competing versions of 
 a record wins) and discards the losing version without alerting the user. 
 An automatic resolution only happens if the OEP-Offline user does not 
 risk losing data.</li>
            <li>If the Collision Handler cannot resolve the collision 
 automatically or there is a risk of losing data when discarding the losing 
 version, the Collision Handler presents both versions of the record to 
 the OEP-Offline user in the Synchronization Issues page for manual resolution 
 of the collision.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Presented with the competing versions of the record, 
 the OEP-Offline user can: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose his or her version of the record and retry 
 the upsync by synchronizing again. </li>
            <li>Copy data from the other version of the record 
 to incorporate into his or her own version, discard the other version, 
 and then synchronize again. </li>
            <li>Accept the other version of the record. </li>
        </ul>
