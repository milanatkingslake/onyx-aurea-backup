        <h1>What is Onyx Processing Server? </h1>
        <p>The Onyx Processing Server (OPS) is a Microsoft Windows service that 
 performs background processing for the Onyx Enterprise Application Server 
 (OEAS). </p>
        <p>The OPS service can control any number of subsystems 
 and their processes. OPS controls the following types of subsystems: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="AR_ca_opsoeasfeatures.htm">Fulfillment 
 subsystem</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="AR_ca_ops_Batch_subsystem_overview.htm">Batch 
 subsystem</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="AR_CA_OPSEMSOverview.htm">Email monitor 
 subsystem</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As an administrator, you can schedule OPS to process 
 various tasks at specified time intervals. Two tools control the OPS service: 
 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using the Windows administration tool (from the 
 Control Panel, select Administration Tools and choose Services), you can 
 control the main OPS service. This tool provides access to the standard 
 Windows services property pages and standard tasks, such as start, stop, 
 pause, resume, and restart. When you perform any of these tasks on the 
 OPS services, it affects all subsystems that are controlled by OPS.</li>
            <li>Using the OPS Administration tool, you can control 
 each OPS subsystem individually, as well as the OPS service itself. Onyx 
 recommends that you use this tool instead of the Windows administration 
 tool, because it provides a complete interface for managing OPS and its 
 subsystems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For details about installing and configuring OPS and the OPS Administration 
 tool, see the <span style="font-style: italic;">OEAS Installation Guide</span>.
