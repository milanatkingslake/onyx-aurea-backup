        <h2>OPS Service Error Handling</h2>
        <p>OPS service and subsystem errors are logged to the Windows Event Log. 
 OPS service errors are logged to the Application event log, while OPS 
 subsystem errors are logged to the connection event log that is created 
 via OPS Configuration. </p>
        <p>During OPS installation, you can configure the OPS service to send error 
 notifications in an email message to a specific mailbox. Likewise, using 
 OPS Administration, you can configure OPS subsystems to send their errors 
 to specific mailboxes. </p>
        <p>Connection-specific event logs are always named with 
 the connection's logical application name and begin with the “OPS_” prefix. 
 For example, running OPS Configuration twice to set up connections to 
 the Main and Secondary logical applications creates the following two 
 event logs: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>OPS_Main</li>
            <li>OPS_Secondary</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Subsystem errors are logged to their respective connection’s event logs. 
 For more information on sync subsystem event logging, see Logging. 
 </p>
        <p>You can also configure OPS to send error notification emails for the 
 OPS service and subsystems to specified mailboxes. Note that an error 
 condition that persists over an extended period of time can generate a 
 large volume of email messages. </p>
