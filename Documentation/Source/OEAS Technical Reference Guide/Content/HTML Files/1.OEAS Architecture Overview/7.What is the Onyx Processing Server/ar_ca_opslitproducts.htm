        <h3>Literature Products </h3>
        <p>A literature product is any type of item that can be delivered as mail, 
 or email, and that you have configured as a literature product using 
 Product Administration. Literature products can include letters, brochures, 
 white papers, photographs, mailing lists, software programs, or informational 
 packets or promotional pamphlets that you send to customers to promote 
 and supplement your standard products. </p>
        <p>A literature product typically refers to a template 
 document for print, or email literature products. The templates contain 
 code that merges data into the output literature product. The templates 
 are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>For print literature products, an Open XML Word document with Mail Merge.</li>
            <li>For email literature products, an XSL stylesheet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, physical items and system documents are also literature products.</p>
        <p>OPS merges literature order and order line data using templates to produce 
 email and printed documents. You can customize and use sample templates 
 that are installed during OPS setup. For information on customizing template 
 documents, see <a href="../../2.OEAS Features/AR_CA_Templates.htm">Templates</a>.</p>
        <p>OPS also supports sending files as attachments to electronic documents 
 (email) without performing any data merging.</p>
        <p>After a template has been created, you create a literature product in 
 Product Administration that references the file path to the template. 
 The following table describes the literature product attributes that OPS 
 uses during processing. You can modify these attributes using Product 
 Administration. </p>
