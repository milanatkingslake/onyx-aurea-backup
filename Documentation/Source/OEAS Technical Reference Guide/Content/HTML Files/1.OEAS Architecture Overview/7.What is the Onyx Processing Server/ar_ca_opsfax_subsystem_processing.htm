        <h4>Fax Subsystem Processing</h4>
        <p>Fax subsystems process order lines for literature 
 products with a Send as Fax fulfillment type. Choosing Send as Fax fulfillment 
 type can have one of two results: </p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>For Send as Fax (supports merging), the fax fulfillment 
 engine creates a merged document based on the XSL template associated 
 with the literature product and the input literature order line. Using 
 SMTP, the fax engine sends the merged document as an attachment to the 
 Fax server which is configured to provide the fax fulfillment. Typically, 
 the Fax server uses the SMTP header information to address the fax and 
 uses the attachment to create the body of the fax.</li>
            <li>For Send as Fax (no merging), the fax fulfillment 
 engine identifies the file to be sent as specified by the literature product. 
 Using SMTP, the fax engine sends the file as an attachment to the Fax 
 server which is configured to provide the fax fulfillment. Typically, 
 the Fax server uses the SMTP header information to address the fax and 
 uses the attachment to create the body of the fax.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When the system administrator creates and configures the fax subsystem, 
 he or she specifies a configuration style sheet which implements default 
 SMTP header information for every fax. The fax template designer can include 
 optional header information on a per product basis. For instance, optional 
 header information might be useful for tracking purposes.</p>
        <p>In both cases below there is SMTP header information that comes from 
 a default email configuration template which was specified in OPS admin 
 for the subsystem. </p>
