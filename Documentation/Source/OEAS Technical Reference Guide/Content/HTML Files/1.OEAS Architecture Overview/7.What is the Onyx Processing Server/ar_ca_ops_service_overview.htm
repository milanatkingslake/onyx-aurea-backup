        <h2>OPS Service Overview</h2>
        <p>The OPS service is a Windows service that manages subsystems and lifetimes 
 of the subsystem's processes. The service provides an interface for the 
 Windows Service Control Manager and the OPS Administration tool for configuring 
 and controlling the service and subsystems.</p>
        <p>The subsystems are COM servers packaged as executable files that run 
 their own processes. The following types of subsystems are available: 
 batch, fulfillment, and email monitor. </p>
        <p>Fulfillment subsystems are configured with a print engine (print subsystem) or
 an email engine (email subsystem) and 
 are responsible for processing literature orders. A print subsystem provides 
 print fulfillment using print templates. The template is a Open XML Word with Mail Merge. Email subsystem 
 provides literature fulfillment using templates, which are Extensible Stylesheet 
 Language (XSL) files, for data merging and Collaboration Data Objects 
 (CDO) for Windows to send literature products through SMTP. </p>
        <p>Batch subsystems are responsible for processing List Manager actions. 
 </p>
        <p>Email monitor subsystems track inbound emails to a given mailbox and 
 associate them with the appropriate OEDB data.</p>
        <p>You can only install one instance of the OPS service per OPS server. 
 However, on that OPS server you can create multiple instances of the subsystems.</p>
        <h4>Multi-tenancy environment</h4>
        <p>Subsystems can be used in a multi-tenancy environment. When a new subsystem 
 is created, an alternate ID is generated. The ID allows for duplicate 
 subsystem names and subsystem IDs in a duplicated environment where OPS 
 interacts with multiple OEAS applications. The ID is globally unique and 
is used for error notifications, event log entries, etc. </p>
        <p class="Important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Because OPS interacts with OEAS and OEDB, you must stop 
 the OPS service prior to taking OEAS or OEDB offline.</p>
