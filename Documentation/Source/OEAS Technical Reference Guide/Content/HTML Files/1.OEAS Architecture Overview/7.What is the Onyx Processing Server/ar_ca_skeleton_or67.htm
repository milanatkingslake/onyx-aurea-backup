        <h3>System Document Failure</h3>
        <p>System documents are typically essential for the fulfillment operator 
 to perform fulfillment duties. A failure to process a system document 
 is considered a critical failure. This is because if a subsystem were 
 to continue processing order lines after a system document failure, the 
 status for physical items would be updated to Completed but the items 
 would never appear in a system document since the document failed to be 
 processed. </p>
        <p>Therefore, a failure to process a system document 
 immediately halts processing for the remaining order lines in the batch, 
 and the subsystem enters an error state, which means that the status for 
 order lines in the batch is updated as follows: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>System documents that were not processed are updated 
 to Error.</li>
            <li>All non-system documents remain as In Process.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The subsystem logs the errors to the OPS service log as well as the 
 subsystem log. Error notification is sent if configured to do so. The 
 subsystem remains in an error state until the error has been corrected 
 and the subsystem is restarted. At that time, the subsystem resumes processing 
 the batch where the error occurred. The subsystem adds new batch and order 
 system documents to the resumed batch. This addition of new batch and 
 order system documents can result in duplicate system documents. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Example: System document failure </p>
        <p>This example describes the sequence of events when 
 a system document fails during processing. In this scenario, 50 orders 
 with one order line each are in the New Order Lines queue and the subsystem 
 is configured with the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Batch Size: 50</li>
            <li>Two batch system documents</li>
            <li>One order system document</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following events take place: </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>The subsystem retrieves the new order lines and 
 begins processing.</li>
        </ol>

            <li class="List_Indent">The total number of order lines is 50.</li>
            <li class="List_Indent">The order line status is updated from New

        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" start="2">
            <li>A new order is added to the batch with two batch
