        <h3>Synchronization Errors</h3>
        <p>Synchronization errors are handled on a per-item basis. If one item 
 fails to upsync, the other items waiting to upsync are processed. An exception 
 is when the failed item is an insert and other items are descendants of 
 it. For example, if a quote header errors, its quote lines cannot upsync 
 either. </p>
        <p>If the sync subsystem cannot upsync an offline record or retrieve an 
 online record required for collision handling, it does not call the Collision 
 Handler but generates an error. It reports the error to the offline user 
 on the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Errors</span> tab of the Synchronization 
 Issues page of OEP-Offline. The userâ€™s response usually should be to save 
 the record and resubmit it for upsyncing. </p>
        <p>After each client synchronization, users should check the Synchronization 
 Issues page on the OEP-Offline client application to resolve any items 
 in error or conflict. While a record on the staging server has a synchronization 
 error, any updates to that record made by OEP online users are not downsynced 
 to the staging server. </p>
        <p>Synchronization errors can occur when: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A business rule has been violated (for example, 
 a user tries to insert a record without providing all of the necessary 
 data).</li>
            <li>A component involved in the synchronization process 
 fails to complete its work (for example, the staging server or the OEDB 
 is down).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>OEP-Offline users can fix synchronization errors by editing the record 
 and resaving it. Alternatively, users can choose to discard their offline 
 version and revert to the previous online version. </p>
