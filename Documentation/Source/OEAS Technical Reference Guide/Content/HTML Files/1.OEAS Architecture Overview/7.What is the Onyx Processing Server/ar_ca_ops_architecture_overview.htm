        <h2>OPS Architecture Overview</h2>
        <p>OPS interacts with OEAS to process literature orders, List Manager actions, and inbound emails to a monitored mailbox. OPS is configured to interact with a specific OEAS server during 
 OPS setup. After setup is complete, you link the OPS service to an OEAS 
 logical application by creating a connection between them. You can create 
 multiple connections, but each connection must point to a unique combination 
 of database (OEDB) and site ID. You create these connections before adding 
 and configuring subsystems. You create them using OPS Configuration, which 
 is located on the installation CD. </p>
        <p class="Important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"> An OPS server cannot interact with multiple OEAS servers. 
 However, multiple OPS servers can be configured to interact with the same 
 OEAS server.</p>
        <p>The two main components of OPS are the: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>OPS service </li>
            <li>OPS Administration tool</li>
        </ul>
