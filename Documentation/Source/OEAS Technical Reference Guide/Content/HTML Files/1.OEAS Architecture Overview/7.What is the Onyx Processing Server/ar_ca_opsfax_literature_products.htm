        <h4>Fax Literature Products</h4>
        <p>Fax literature products are literature products configured 
 with one or more of the following fax fulfillment types: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Send as Fax (supports merging)</li>
            <li>Send as Fax (no merging)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using the Literature feature, users can order fax literature products 
 which are fulfilled via fax. Fax literature products can be created from 
 XSL templates which support data merging. Sample templates are installed 
 during the OPS installation. You can customize them to create personalized 
 fax messages. </p>
        <p>Fax literature products can also be binary files that are sent as-is 
 with no data merging.</p>
