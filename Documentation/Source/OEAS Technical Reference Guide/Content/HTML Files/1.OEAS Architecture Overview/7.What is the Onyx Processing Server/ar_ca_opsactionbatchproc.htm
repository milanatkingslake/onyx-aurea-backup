        <h4>Action Batch Processing</h4>
        <p>Batch subsystems use the following attributes to retrieve 
 and process action batches: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Subsystem operation window</li>
            <li>Subsystem run interval</li>
            <li>Subsystem governor interval</li>
            <li>Subsystem active status</li>
            <li>Action batch status</li>
            <li>Action batch XML</li>
            <li>Action batch processing dates</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following sections define these attributes. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Operation window.</b> A subsystem's 
 operation window is the time frame within which the subsystem processes 
 action batches. You can configure the subsystem to process 24 hours a 
 day or just within a specified time period that is defined by the Start 
 Time and Stop Time settings. To configure a subsystem to process 24 hours 
 a day, set both the Start Time and Stop Time to 00:00. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Run interval.</b> The run interval 
 is the time between subsystem checks of the new batches queue for batches 
 with a status of new. The interval is defined by the Run Interval setting in OPS Administration. During this time, 
 the subsystem continuously retrieves and processes action batches as long 
 as the New Batches queue has items with New status. If the queue has no 
 such items, the subsystem waits for the period of time defined by Run 
 Interval before checking the queue again. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Governor interval.</b> The governor 
 interval determines the speed at which the batch subsystem makes OEAS 
 calls. To process an action batch, the subsystem makes calls to OEAS. 
 Thousands of calls may be necessary, which can overwhelm OEAS and degrade 
 system performance. The interval is how long in milliseconds that the 
 subsystem waits between calls to OEAS. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Active status.</b> You can configure 
 a subsystem as active or inactive using OPS Administration. When the OPS 
 service is started, active subsystems also start while inactive subsystems 
 do not. </p>
        <p>However, you can explicitly start an inactive subsystem. When the OPS 
 service is stopped or paused, all subsystems with a status of started, 
 regardless of active status, also stop or pause accordingly. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Action 
 batch</span> status.</b> The action batch status tracks action-batch 
 processing. Like fulfillment subsystems, batch subsystems process only 
 action batches whose status is New. When the subsystem retrieves a New 
 action batch for processing, the action batchâ€™s status is updated to In 
 Process. When processing of the action batch completes successfully, the 
 status is updated to Completed. In the event of a failure, the status 
 is updated to Error. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Action batch XML.</b> The action batch 
 XML contains the information that defines which OEAS method calls are 
 executed by the batch subsystem for an action batch. A batch subsystem 
 might make multiple calls to OEAS when processing an action batch. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Processing dates. </b>The batch subsystem 
 processes action batches first-in-first-out. If the action batch has a 
 scheduled process date that occurs in the future, the subsystem waits 
 until that date to process the action batch. </p>
