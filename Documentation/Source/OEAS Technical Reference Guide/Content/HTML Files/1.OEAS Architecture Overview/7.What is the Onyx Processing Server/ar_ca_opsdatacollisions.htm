        <h3>Collisions</h3>
        <p>When errors occur during synchronization, it is often because of collisions. 
 A typical collision happens when a user subscribes to a record and updates 
 it, but before the user upsyncs that version of the record, another user 
 saves another version of the same record. The collision occurs when the 
 user with the subscribed record attempts to save a now out-of-date version. 
 </p>
        <p>OEP-Offline informs users whenever a collision occurs and cannot be 
 resolved automatically. When users are notified of a collision, they can 
 use OEP-Offline to view both versions of the record: the offline version 
 and the most recent copy of that record obtained from the OEDB. Users 
 compare the versions, choose which one to keep, edit that version if necessary, 
 and upsync the record again. Users have an opportunity to verify that 
 the upsynced record contains all relevant data and that no data is unknowingly 
 deleted during the synchronization process. </p>
