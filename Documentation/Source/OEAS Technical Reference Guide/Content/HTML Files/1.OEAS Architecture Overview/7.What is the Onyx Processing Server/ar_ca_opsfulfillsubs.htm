        <h4>Understanding Fulfillment Subsystems</h4>
        <p>Fulfillment subsystems process order lines. Each fulfillment subsystem 
 is configured either to print or to send an email. A fulfillment subsystem 
 configured to print is a <em class="Emphasis">print subsystem.</em> A fulfillment subsystem configured to 
 send email is an <em class="Emphasis">email subsystem.</em> You can have 
 multiple fulfillment subsystems, each with unique settings. </p>
        <p>Order lines are processed according to the attributes of literature 
 products, order lines, and subsystem settings. </p>
        <p>Fulfillment subsystems retrieve order lines for processing 
 based on the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Subsystem operation window</li>
            <li>Subsystem run interval</li>
            <li>Subsystem batch size</li>
            <li>Subsystem active status</li>
            <li>Order line status</li>
            <li>Order line priority</li>
            <li>Order line fulfillment type</li>
            <li>Order line insert date</li>
            <li>Order line scheduled process date</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following sections discuss these settings. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Subsystem operation window.</b> A subsystem's 
 operation window is the time frame within which the subsystem processes 
 literature orders. You can configure a subsystem to process 24 hours a 
 day or just within a specified time period defined by the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Start 
 Time</span> and <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Stop Time</span> settings. To configure 
 a subsystem to process 24 hours a day, set both the Start Time and Stop 
 Time to 00:00. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Subsystem run interval.</b> The run 
 interval is the time between subsystem checks of the new order lines queue 
 for order lines with a status of new. Fulfillment subsystems have two 
 intervals: standard priority and high priority. During the standard-priority 
 interval, both high and standard-priority orders are processed. This interval 
 is defined by the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Standard Priority Run Interval</span> 
 setting. During the high-priority interval, only high-priority order lines 
 are processed. This interval is defined by the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">High 
 Priority Run Interval</span> setting. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Subsystem batch size
.</b> The batch size is the approximate number of order lines that a subsystem 
 retrieves for processing at one time. Several rules affect the actual 
 number of order lines included in a batch: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Orders are never split. If the batch size is reached 
 in the middle of an order, the remaining order lines are included in the 
 batch.</li>
            <li>Order lines for mailing labels are counted as 
 part of the batch size.</li>
            <li>Order lines for system documents are not counted 
 as part of the batch size.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Suppose that you have a batch size set to 1000 and the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">New 
 Order Lines</span> queue has 2000 orders, each with two order lines. When 
 the subsystem retrieves the order lines, it picks up only 500 orders for 
 processing, because batch size is the total number of order lines (500 
 orders x 2 order lines each = 1000 order lines). </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Subsystem active status.</b> You can 
 configure a subsystem as active or inactive using OPS Administration. 
 When the OPS service is started, active subsystems also start while inactive 
 subsystems do not. </p>
        <p>However, you can explicitly start an inactive subsystem. When the OPS 
 service is stopped or paused, all subsystems with a status of started, 
 regardless of active status, also stop or pause accordingly. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Order line status.</b> The order line 
 status is for tracking order line processing. A subsystem retrieves only 
 order lines that have the status of New. When a new order line is retrieved, 
 its status is updated to In Process. When processing is complete and the 
 order line has been printed or emailed successfully, the status is updated 
 to Completed. In the event of a failure, the status is updated to Error. 
 </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Order line priority<span style="font-weight: normal;">.</span></b>
 The order line priority indicates either immediate or standard handling. 
 A subsystem retrieves immediate priority items within the next high priority 
 interval, otherwise it retrieves standard priority items during standard 
 priority intervals according to the other queuing criteria.</p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Order line processing dates.</b> Order 
 lines are processed first-in-first-out, which means that order lines with 
 the oldest insert date are processed first. 
 The exception to this rule are order lines with a scheduled process date 
 set to a date in the future. These order lines are not processed before 
 this date. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Order Line status update.</b> When 
 a fulfillment subsystem is processing a batch of order lines, the order 
 lineâ€™s status is updated in the database in groups. The size of the group 
 is configured in the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Maximum Order Line Update Count</span> 
 setting in OPS Configuration. The setting allows for the database to be 
 updated in bulk for better performance. </p>
