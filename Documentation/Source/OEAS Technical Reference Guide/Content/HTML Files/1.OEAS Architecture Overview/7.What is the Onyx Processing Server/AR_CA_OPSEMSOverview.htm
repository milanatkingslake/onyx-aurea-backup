        <h2>Email Monitor Subsystem</h2>
        <p>The email monitor subsystem (EMS) monitors Microsoft Exchange mailboxes 
 for inbound email that is related to an Onyx record (the inbound email 
 is a reply to email sent from OEAS), and for saving the email to OEDB. 
 Using certain information in the email header, such as the sender and 
 recipient email addresses and an internal thread identifier, the EMS subsystem 
 associates inbound mail with companies, individuals, and Onyx users. Using 
 these associations, inbound emails are made available on customer and 
 incident history lists. </p>
        <p>EMS continuously monitors mailboxes on designated mail servers for inbound 
 emails. For email addresses that are publicized via Websites or print 
 media, for instance, you can configure EMS to examine mailboxes for inbound 
 emails and to insert the emails (along with their attachments) into the 
 OEDB. </p>
