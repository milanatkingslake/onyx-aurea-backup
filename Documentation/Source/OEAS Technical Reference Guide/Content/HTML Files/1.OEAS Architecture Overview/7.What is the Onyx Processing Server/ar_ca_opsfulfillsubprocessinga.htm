        <h4>Fulfillment Subsystem Processing and Control </h4>
        <p>When the fulfillment subsystem processes a batch of order lines, the 
 order lines goes through the following three stages: </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Reservation. </b>Order lines are retrieved from OEAS for processing. This action is called 
 <em class="Emphasis">reserving</em> the order lines. When a fulfillment 
 subsystem reserves an order line, the status is updated from New to In 
 Process and the line is marked with the subsystem's ID and batch ID. Once 
 reserved, only the reserving subsystem can process the order line.</li>
            <li><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Fulfillment. </b>The subsystem fulfills the order lines via email or print.</li>
            <li><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Completion. </b>Status of each order lines is updated to Completed. In the event of a 
 failure, the order line’s status is updated to Error.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A fulfillment subsystem’s response to stopping, pausing, or continuing 
 depends on whether the subsystem is currently processing order lines. 
 If processing is not currently taking place, the subsystem responds immediately 
 to the action. If, however, the subsystem is currently processing order 
 lines, the subsystem responds as described in the following table. </p>
        <table style="width: 100%;">
            <col />
            <col />
            <thead>
                <tr>

                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p class="Table_Text">Subsystem stops after processing completes 
 for the current order line. Remaining order lines in the order are not 
 processed until you restart the subsystem. </p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p class="Table_Text">Pause </p>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p class="Table_Text">Subsystem pauses after processing completes 
 for the current order line. Remaining order lines are not processed until 
 you continue the subsystem. </p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p class="Table_Text">Continue </p>

                    <td>
                        <p class="Table_Text">Subsystem processes remaining order lines for 
 the order whose processing was interrupted. </p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>If a subsystem is stopped or fails after the reservation stage, the 
 batch is considered <em class="Emphasis">incomplete</em> because there are 
 order lines with the status of In Process remaining in the batch. When 
 you restart the subsystem, it automatically resumes processing incomplete 
 batches. All order lines with a status of In Process are processed first. 
 If for some reason the reserving subsystem is unavailable for processing, 
 the order lines will not be processed unless their status is updated to 
 New. </p>
        <p>Print and email subsystems process batches of order 
 lines similarly: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>When a subsystem begins processing, it first checks 
 for incomplete batches. </li>
            <li>The subsystem does not reserve or begin processing 
 a new batch until it has completed processing on the incomplete batches. 
 </li>
            <li>The subsystem processes the oldest incomplete 
 batch first. </li>
            <li>The subsystem logs a warning to the Event Log 
 when it resumes processing an incomplete batch.</li>
        </ul>
