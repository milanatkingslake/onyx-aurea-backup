        <h3>Server Synchronization</h3>
        <p>During synchronization, the sync subsystem upsyncs the data of a user 
 subscription profile from the staging server to the OEDB and then downsyncs 
 that data from the OEDB to the staging server. To do so, the sync subsystem: 
 </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>Identifies records on the staging server that 
 are new or have changed since the last upsync and calls OEAS methods on 
 the appropriate business objects to process save, delete, and unsubscribe 
 records in the OEDB. </li>
            <li>Identifies data collisions and calls the Collision 
 Handler to try to resolve the collisions. </li>
            <li>Identifies records that have been changed, deleted, 
 subscribed, and unsubscribed in the OEDB since the last downsync and applies 
 the OEDB changes to the staging server data store. The sync subsystem 
 also identifies new records that need to be added to the staging server 
 data store because of subscription requests and relationships. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">The server synchronization formats Onyx data as 
 Exchange messages. It places the messages in OEP-Offline usersâ€™ folders 
 within a dedicated public folder in the staging server data store. </p>
        <p class="Indent1">Except for <em class="Emphasis">tightly coupled</em> 
 records and other closely related records, each folder contains one message 
 per record. Tightly coupled records are records that have a parent-child 
 relationship and that are always dealt with as a single unit, therefore, 
 they are stored in a single message. Forecast/ForecastLine and Quote/QuoteLine 
 are tightly coupled records. Other closely related records that are contained 
 within single messages are Phones and Addresses and their owning Individual 
 and Company record.</p>
