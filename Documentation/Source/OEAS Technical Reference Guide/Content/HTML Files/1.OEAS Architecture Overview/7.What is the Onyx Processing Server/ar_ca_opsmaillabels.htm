        <h4>Mailing Labels </h4>
        <p>You can configure mailing labels to be generated with print literature 
 products or physical items. A label is associated with an Open XML Word template with Mail Merge fields
 that supports data merging. Sample templates for mailing 
 labels are installed during the OPS installation. Once the label literature 
 product has been created, you can associate it with other literature products. 
 Typically, a specific printer is designated to print only labels. </p>
