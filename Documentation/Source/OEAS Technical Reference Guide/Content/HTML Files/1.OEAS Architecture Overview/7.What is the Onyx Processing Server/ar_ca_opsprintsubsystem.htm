        <h4>Print Subsystem Processing </h4>
        <p>The print subsystem processes batches of order lines 
 for print literature products with the following fulfillment types: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Send as Printed Document (this type includes mailing 
 labels)</li>
            <li>Send as Physical Item</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To process these order lines, you first configure a fulfillment subsystem 
 with a print engine, which creates a print subsystem. Printable literature 
 products are created from Open XML Word with Mail Merge that supports 
 data merging. A literature product that references this template must 
 then be created. When an order is created for this literature product, 
 the print subsystem processes the order line and, using the print logic 
 in the template, sends it directly to the specified printer. These products 
 can be printed for internal use or shipped to customers. For more information 
 on creating print templates, see "Print templates" in <a href="../../7.OEAS Developers Reference/OEAS_customizing_ops.htm">Customizing OPS</a>.</p>
        <p>Within a batch, print batch system document order lines are printed 
 first. Within an order, print order system document order lines are printed 
 first, then remaining print order lines are printed. </p>
        <p>To process the print order line, the subsystem determines 
 the destination printer as follows: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The literatureOrderLine's printerName property 
 is used if it is not null.</li>
            <li>If the literatureOrderLine's printerName property 
 is null, the printer associated with the literature product ordered is 
 used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The literatureOrderLine's printerName and the literature 
 product's associated printer must reference a network printer via an UNC 
 path. </p>
