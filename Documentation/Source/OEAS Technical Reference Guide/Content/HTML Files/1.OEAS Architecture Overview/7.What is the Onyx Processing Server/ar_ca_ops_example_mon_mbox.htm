        <h3>Example: Monitored Mailboxes</h3>
        <p>This example consists of one EMS subsystem that monitors three mailboxes. 
 </p>
        <p>The following table describes the processing settings that you would 
 specify in OPS Administration for this example. The first four settings 
 in the table are subsystem settings. The last setting, Maximum Processing 
 Time, is a setting specific to each monitored mailbox. </p>

        <p>The following flowchart illustrates how and when the subsystem processes 
 inbound email. When a run interval begins, the subsystem first determines 
 whether the current time falls within the start time and the stop time 
 of the processing window. </p>

        <p>Using the example values from the preceding table, the significant processing 
 steps of the EMS between at 5:50 A.M. and 8:15 A.M. are described below: 
 </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>At 5:50 the EMS process checks the current time 
 and determines that it does not fall within the processing window. The 
 EMS enters sleep mode.</li>
            <li>At 6:00 the EMS thread determines that it is now 
 in the processing window. It processes new emails in mailbox 1 for two 
 minutes, then goes to mailbox 2 for three minutes, and finally goes to 
 mailbox 3 for five minutes. After each inbound email that the EMS processes, 
 it pauses for the 100 millisecond governor interval before processing 
 another email message. The governor interval prevents the EMS from utilizing 
 much of OEAS resources during the run interval. </li>
            <li>The EMS then returns to mailbox 1 to repeat the 
 cycle until there are no more new emails in any of the mailboxes. This 
 only happens as long as the current time falls within the processing widow. 
 When the stop time of the processing window is reached, the EMS stops 
 processing emails even when there are unread emails in some of the mailboxes. 
 </li>
            <li>All inbound emails are processed by 6:13. The 
 EMS enters sleep mode for the remaining time.</li>
            <li>The EMS determines at 6:20 that it is still inside 
 the processing window, and it checks for and processes any new email in 
 the monitored mailboxes. Processing is finished in one iteration by 6:23. 
 </li>
            <li>The EMS continues to check the monitored mailboxes 
 and process inbound email for the next hour and a half. At 8:00 the EMS 
 determines that it is still within the processing window. It processes 
 several emails and enters sleep mode at 8:04.</li>
            <li>At 8:14 the EMS finds that it is now outside the 
 processing window, and it enters sleep mode immediately.</li>
            <li>The EMS continues to check for the processing 
 window throughout the day.</li>
        </ol>
