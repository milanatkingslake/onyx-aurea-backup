        <h3>Literature Orders </h3>
        <p>The Literature Orders feature provides a way for your 
 employees to order literature products for mailing or sending with email 
 messages to your customers. When a user creates a literature order, the 
 user selects: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>One or more literature products</li>
            <li>The fulfillment type for each order line</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The fulfillment types available consist of the types associated with 
 the product in Product Administration. Each line item, or order line, 
 consists of a product, fulfillment type, and quantity. To understand how a literature order line is processed, see <a href="ar_ca_literature_order_line_process_flow.htm">Literature order line process flow</a>.</p>
        <p>The following table lists a subset of literature order object properties 
 that OPS uses. The table uses friendly names in place of the literal property 
 names. For more information,
