        <h2>Relationships</h2>
        <p>OEAS enables customers to define relationships between logical 
 objects in an OEAS application. Each relationship correlates properties 
 on two objects. One object's property refers to the other object's primary 
 key property. Relationships are used for cascading <a href="AR_ca_whatsnew_Deletes.htm">deletes</a> 
 and to enforce referential integrity that can not be enforced through 
 foreign keys defined in the database. Customers define relationships in 
 Object Designer without having to write any code. With <a href="AR_ca_whatsnew_SQL_generation_(SQLGen).htm">SQLGen</a>, 
 you can make any object, including a custom object, an owner of another 
 object by creating relationships in <a href="AR_ca_whatsnew_OED_structure.htm">OED</a>.</p>
