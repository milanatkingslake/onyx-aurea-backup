        <h2>Customizing Objects and Tables</h2>
        <p>The new OEAS supports customizing objects and tables without writing 
 any code.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureHeading">To add custom data to an existing object:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Add a custom column to the appropriate table in 
 the database</li>
            <li>Add the column's physical description to the Onyx 
 Enterprise Dictionary (OED)</li>
            <li>Add a logical property description to the OED</li>
            <li>Create a map between the logical property and 
 the physical description in the OED</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By default, <a href="AR_ca_whatsnew_SQL_generation_(SQLGen).htm">SQLGen 
 automatically provides CRUD</a> support for custom data (columns) implemented 
 with the previous procedure. The procedure for adding custom objects is 
 similar but a little more involved, as the customer must create a new 
 database table and all of its logical and physical descriptions and mappings 
 in the OED, however no coding is required for CRUD functionality. </p>
        <p>To make this procedure faster and easier, Object Designer supports copy 
 and paste of most nodes with the notable exception of logical-physical 
 maps. You can copy an object and paste a duplicate within Object Designer. 
 By renaming, adding, and deleting nodes (object, method, property, and 
 so on) in the duplicate, you can quickly build custom objects. Nodes can 
 be copied and pasted across owner objects as in copying a property from 
 one object to another.</p>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="../../7.OEAS Developers Reference/Customizing_Overview.htm">Customizing OEAS</a> and <a href="../5.What is the Onyx Enterprise Database/ar_ca_whatisoedb.htm">Customizing 
 OEDB</a>.</p>
        <h4>UDF Support</h4>
        <p>Although UDF (User Defined Field) properties are still supported, Onyx 
 recommends using the previously described approach instead, to ensure 
 meaningful names and strongly typed data. The latter is important especially 
 in the light of new support for <a href="AR_ca_whatsnew_Data_validation.htm">data 
 validation</a>. Using Reference Table Administration, UDFs are a quick 
 way to implement hierarchical relationships between UI drop-down list 
 controls.</p>
