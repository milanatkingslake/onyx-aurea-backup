        <h2>Partial Updates</h2>
        <p>With SQLGen, all objects support partial updates. A partial update occurs 
 when an update call to the database excludes some object parameters. This 
 exclusion of parameters translates to less coding for updating data. In 
 other words, supporting partial update (and insert) enables developers 
 to create a UI that only uses certain properties on an object, and to 
 have that UI continue to function if the object is later enhanced with 
 additional properties. &#160;Without 
 this capability, adding any property to an object would require a change 
 to every UI that uses the object for insert or update, or it requires 
 custom logic in the middle tier. &#160;With 
 partial insert or update, no change is required at all as long as the 
 newly added properties are not required or have a default value. Partial 
 updates also reduce the amount of data that has to travel across the network. 
 </p>
        <p>OEAS places some restrictions on data required for an update. For more 
 information on the update and insert methods, see <a href="../../7.OEAS Developers Reference/standard_oeas_behavior.htm">Standard OEAS behavior</a>.</p>
