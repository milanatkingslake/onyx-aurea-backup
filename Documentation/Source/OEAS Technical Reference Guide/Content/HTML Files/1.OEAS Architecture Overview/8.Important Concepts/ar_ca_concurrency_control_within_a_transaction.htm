        <h3>Concurrency Control within a Transaction</h3>
        <p>The optimistic concurrency control of the Onyx Enterprise 
 Database (OEDB) supports the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>No records are locked outside of a database or 
 COM transaction.</li>
            <li>Records within database or COM transactions are 
 locked, preventing users from overwriting each otherâ€™s data.</li>
            <li>Locked records are released at the completion 
 of a transaction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An attempt is made to lock a record within a transaction. If the record 
 is locked, the database will pause until the other transaction has been 
 completed and the new lock can be acquired. The value retrieved for the 
 onyxTimestamp property is checked after the lock has been acquired. </p>
