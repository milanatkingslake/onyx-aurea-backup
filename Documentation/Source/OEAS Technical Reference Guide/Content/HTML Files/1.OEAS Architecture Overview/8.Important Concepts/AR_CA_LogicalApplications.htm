        <h2>Logical Applications</h2>
        <p>Onyx Enterprise Application Server (OEAS) uses the concept of logical 
 applications to support multiple organizations on a single OEAS server. 
 This enables efficient use of resources in an application service provider 
 (ASP) environment. </p>
        <p>When you install OEAS, you can configure one or more logical applications. 
 Most companies need to create only one logical application. Other companies, 
 however, such as application service providers (ASPs), may need to configure 
 multiple logical applications so that they can host and support numerous 
 enterprises on a single OEAS server. </p>
        <p>Each OEAS logical application is defined by the application name, the 
 Onyx Enterprise Database connection information, and the copy of the Onyx 
 Enterprise Dictionary (OED). Each logical application on a given OEAS 
 server must be uniquely named, so that OEAS can tell which application 
 is referenced by a client request. </p>
        <p>You can configure logical applications to use different 
 combinations of OED and Onyx Enterprise Database instances as in the following 
 list. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a unique OED and a unique database. This is 
 the most typical and recommended configuration for most companies that 
 use the OEAS internally.</li>
            <li>Share an OED and use unique databases. You use 
 this for sharing application server customizations with multiple customers.</li>
            <li>Use a unique OED and share a database. Onyx does 
 not recommend this, because the OED contains physical schema information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you configure multiple OEAS logical applications, each one can 
 specify a different set of logical objects, methods, and properties, and 
 each one can point to a different Onyx Enterprise Database. You can also 
 configure the logging characteristics and the Query Engine behavior separately 
 for each logical application. You must run Onyx Configure Enterprise Application 
 Server Setup for each logical application, in order to configure logging 
 and Query Engine behavior. For detailed information on configuring logical 
 applications, see the <i>ONYX <MadCap:variable name="Aptean_Variables.Version number" /> Installation Guide</i>.</p>
        <p>In some situations, such as found in an ASP environment, you may want 
 to use the same business logic for more than one logical application. 
 For example, if you are hosting ten clients, and each client is going 
 to use the OEAS in the same way. You can configure the OEAS to use the 
 same OED for multiple logical applications. In this way, each client (logical 
 application) shares resources on the OEAS server, but each client has 
 its own Onyx Enterprise Database. Any customization to a shared OED changes 
 the business logic for all logical applications sharing that OED. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Using a single OED for multiple logical applications requires 
 additional configuration. If you are interested in this option, please 
 contact Onyx Professional Services. Onyx recommends using an unique OED 
 per logical application for companies that use the OEAS internally. </p>
        <p>Logical applications enable you to offer custom solutions to multiple 
 organizations on a single physical server. This can apply to the ASP environment 
 mentioned previously, or it can apply to a single company that wants to 
 use different business logic for its internal units. The OEAS core components 
 use logical application names to determine which Onyx Enterprise Database 
 and OED to use in a given transaction. </p>
        <p>To ensure that your applications use the business logic defined in the 
 appropriate OED, and that data are saved to the appropriate Onyx Enterprise 
 Database, you must supply a logical application name in the parameters 
 for many of the OEAS core component methods. </p>
