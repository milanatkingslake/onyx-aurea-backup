        <h2>Deletions</h2>
        <p>All deletions of transactional data are logical deletes, while all domain 
 data deletions are physical deletes. A logical delete means that a record 
 is not physically deleted from the database, but rather is updated to 
 contain a non-zero value in its delete_status column. A logical deletion 
 removes a record from active use; logically-deleted data is not visible 
 to users and does not appear in any queries performed on active records. 
 However, because the data is not actually deleted from the database, it 
 is recoverable. </p>
        <p class="Important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Within OEAS documentation, all references to “delete” 
 or “deletions” refer to a logical delete, unless in the context of domain 
 data (such as is discussed with regard to OES tools). </p>
        <h4>Cascade deletes</h4>
        <p>Delete methods within OEAS cascade the delete to child objects according 
 to the cascade type associated with the parent/child relationship. For 
 further information regarding cascade types, see "Relationships" 
 in <a href="../../7.OEAS Developers Reference/Customizing_Overview.htm">Customizing OEAS</a>.</p>
        <h4>Deletions using an administration tool </h4>
        <p>Administration tools are used to manage domain data. As stated previously, 
 domain data deletions are physical, meaning the record is physically deleted 
 from the database and is irrecoverable. In addition, deleting an item 
 that has already been associated with another record is not permitted 
 until you have removed the association, even if the associated record 
 itself has been logically deleted. </p>
        <p>When using the administration tools, Onyx recommends you deactivate 
 data rather than delete data. When you deactivate data, it no longer appears 
 to end users for active use, but it remains an active element of records 
 previously created with it.</p>
