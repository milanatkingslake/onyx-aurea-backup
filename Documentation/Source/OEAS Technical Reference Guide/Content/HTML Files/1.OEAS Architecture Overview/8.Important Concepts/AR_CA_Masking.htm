        <h2>Masking</h2>
        <p>Masks are used within OEAS for data output in order to format and display 
 data consistently in the presentation tier. Phone numbers, for example, 
 typically make use of masking since they are usually stored in the database 
 in one format, but are displayed on the UI in another formatâ€”depending 
 on the formatting conventions of each country. For instance, a ten digit 
 phone number might be stored in the database as 8775551212. When a mask 
 for United States domestic numbers is applied to this number, this phone 
 number can display as either (877) 555-1212 or 877-555-1212. </p>
        <p>OEAS masking works with the masking of the presentation tier, in that 
 it expects the user interface to store data appropriately. For instance, 
 when masks display on the user interface (UI), the masks usually provide 
 the characters that don't change from one input to another. This facilitates 
 the process of data entry since it frees users from having to enter these 
 characters each time certain kind of data, such as a phone number, needs 
 to be input into the system. When a mask is provided in the UI, users 
 do not have to enter these non-numeric characters (the parentheses, the 
 space, or the dash that separates the numbers). Instead, they enter the 
 phone number 8775551212, and the UI captures this data as (877) 555-1212.
