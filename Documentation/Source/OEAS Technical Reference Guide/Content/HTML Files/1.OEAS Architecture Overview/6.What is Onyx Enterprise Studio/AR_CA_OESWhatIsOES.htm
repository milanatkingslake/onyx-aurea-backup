        <h1>What is Onyx Enterprise Studio? </h1>
        <p>Onyx Enterprise Studio (OES) contains Onyx Enterprise 
 Application Server (OEAS) administration and design tools. OES is divided 
 into the Administration Workbench and the Design Workbench: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Administration Workbench includes the administration 
 tools with which administrators can configure features of OEAS.</li>
            <li>The Design Workbench includes tools that require 
 a higher level of technical understanding of OEAS. Technical administrators 
 and developers use these tools to customize OEAS.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All OES tools are Web-based and include HTML-based Help systems. No 
 client-side components are included with these tools. </p>
