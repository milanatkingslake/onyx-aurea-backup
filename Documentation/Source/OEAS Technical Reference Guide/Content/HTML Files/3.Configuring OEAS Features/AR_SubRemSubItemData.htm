        <h3>Removing deleted data from subscription_item </h3>
        <p>The subscription_item table tracks all subscribed data, including the 
 subscribed data that has subsequently been un-subscribed or deleted. Depending 
 on the nature of your organization, subscription_item can become quite 
 large. To help you manage this, the database script subscription_item_cleanup.sql 
 is located on the OEAS product CD. </p>
        <p>You can run this script to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Physically delete any logically deleted subscription_item 
 record (those records with a delete_status=1).</li>
            <li>Physically delete any subscription_item record 
 that refers to a deleted or non-existent transactional record (For instance, 
 the subscription_item record that references a deleted incident would 
 be removed).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Onyx recommends using this script during non-peak hours. </p>
        <p>You can find subscription_item_cleanup.sql on the installation CD at 
 \Utilities\Subscription Integrity Scripts.
