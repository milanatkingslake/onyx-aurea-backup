        <h3>Creating work ticket incident products </h3>
        <p>You can create incident products for work tickets so that end users 
 can choose an incident product to associate with a work ticket. By creating 
 this association, users can search for and retrieve work tickets using 
 the incident product as a search criteria. Once you create an incident 
 product, you can associate it with one or more of your standard products. 
 By associating the incident products with standard products, you can use 
 work tickets to track and categorize issues directly related to a particular 
 product or product line. </p>
        <p>Incident products are stored in the incident_product 
 table, and you can administer them using Product Administration. Briefly, 
 with Product Administration you can: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create new incident products</li>
            <li>Modify existing incident products</li>
            <li>Delete existing incident products</li>
            <li>Link incident products to standard products</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There is no default data installed for the incident products. To create 
 an incident product for work tickets, you must create the incident product 
 for the incident category of <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">work ticket</span>. 
 For more information about creating incident products, see <i>Product Administration Help</i>.</p>
