        <h3>Creating literature products </h3>
        <p>Literature products are a primary component of the Literature Orders 
 feature. End users can order one or more literature products for a customer 
 by creating a literature order for the customer and associating the literature 
 products to that order. </p>
        <p>You can administer literature products using Product 
 Administration. Using this tool, you can: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create new literature products and product groups</li>
            <li>Modify existing literature products and product 
 groups</li>
            <li>Organize literature products by product groups</li>
            <li>Set literature products and product groups to 
 active or inactive</li>
            <li>Delete literature products and product groups</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For information about using Product Administration, see <i>Product Administration Help</i>.</p>
        <p>When you are creating and modifying literature products 
 in Product Administration, there are several literature product attributes 
 that you can also configure. These attributes include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Printer</li>
            <li>Label Product</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For information on configuring these attributes of the literature products, 
 see <a href="AR_ProductProducts.htm">Products</a>. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The Literature feature depends on the Onyx Processing Server 
 (OPS). For literature product configuration guidelines, refer to <i>Using 
 OPS Administration</i>. </p>
