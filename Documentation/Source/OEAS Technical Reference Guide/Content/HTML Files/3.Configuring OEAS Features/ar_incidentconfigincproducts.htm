        <h3>Creating incident products </h3>
        <p>You can create incident products for the different incident categories 
 so that end users can choose an incident product to associate with an 
 incident. By creating this association, users can search for and retrieve 
 incidents using the incident product as a search criteria. Once you create 
 an incident product, you can associate it with one or more of your standard 
 products. By associating the incident products with standard products, 
 you can use incidents to track and categorize issues directly related 
 to a particular product or product line. </p>
        <p>Incident products are stored in the incident_product 
 table, and you can administer them using Product Administration. With 
 Product Administration you can: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create new incident products</li>
            <li>Modify existing incident products</li>
            <li>Delete existing incident products</li>
            <li>Link incident products to standard products</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There is no default data installed for the incident products. To create 
 an incident product for incidents, you must create the incident product 
 for a specific incident category (<span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">sales</span>, 
 <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">service</span>, <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">support, work 
 ticket, or custom</span>). For more information about creating incident 
 products, see "Product Administration Help."</p>
