        <h3>Creating products and product groups </h3>
        <p>You can create products and product groups so that end users can create 
 forecasts and quotes by selecting a product to associate with a forecast 
 or quote record. They select the product from a list in the user interface. 
 The products available in the list consist of standard products and are 
 presented to the end users organized by hierarchical product groups. The 
 Products feature, including standard products and product groups, is described 
 in <a href="../2.OEAS Features/AR_CA_ProductWhatIsProduct.htm">Products</a>. </p>
        <p>There is no default data installed for the products and product groups. 
 You create and administer products and product groups using Product Administration. 
 For more information, see <i>Product Administration Help</i>.</p>
