        <h3>Configuring Assignment Studio processes</h3>
        <p>You can use the OPM Process Designer to modify any of the Assignment 
 Studio processes shipped with OEAS. The ability to create new processes 
 in OPM depends on your licensing agreement. </p>
        <p>To familiarize you with the steps involved, an example is provided below 
 that modifies the "Assign Companies" business process. This 
 example also illustrates the incident escalation described in the OPM 
 Process Design Implementation Guide. For more in-depth information about 
 OPM and its features, refer to the OPM documentation set. </p>
