        <h4>Refreshing the cache </h4>
        <p>Before your custom strings can appear in the end-user interface, you 
 must refresh the cache in order for the most recent copy of the strings 
 to be loaded in memory. </p>
        <p>The OnyxNatLangCache is a core OEAS component that supports high-performance 
 string retrieval for OEAS. At run-time, the cache creates a read-only, 
 in-memory copy of the National Language strings that you have customized 
 and the remaining default OEAS strings. The OnyxNatLangCache is used to 
 cache messages locally on the server to avoid frequent calls to the database. 
 See the <span style="font-style: italic;">OEAS Developer’s Reference</span> 
 for further details about the OnyxNatLangCache component. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To make your changes take effect: </p>
        <ul>
            <li type="disc" class="ListBullet_1">Shut down and then restart the COM+ applications 
 OnyxEASApp and System Application. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">In the Component Services window, these COM+ applications 
 are located under Console Root\Component Services\Computers\My Computer\COM+ 
 Applications. </p>
        <p class="Indent1">The next time you log on to OEAS, these applications 
 will be reloaded and the new National Language strings will be refreshed 
 in the cache. </p>
        <p class="Warning" MadCap:autonum=" &#160;&#160;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Stopping System Application interrupts any work that 
 is occurring within other COM+ applications. Stopping OnyxEASApp stops 
 any work that is occurring in the OEAS components and flushes the caches.</p>
        <p>The OnyxNatLangCache is an OEAS core component that supports high-performance 
 string retrieval for OEAS. At run-time, the OnyxNatLangCache creates a 
 read-only, in-memory copy of the National Language strings that you have 
 customized and the remaining default OEAS strings. This in-memory copy 
 is called the OnyxNatLangCache. The OnyxNatLangCache greatly improves 
 performance by eliminating the need to read data from disk and the need 
 to make frequent calls to the database. See <i>Setting national language information</i> for further details.</p>
        <p>Before the strings that you have customized in Table Administration 
 can appear in the end-user interface, you must refresh the cache so that 
 the most recent copy of the strings can be loaded in memory. Refreshing 
 the cache requires that you unload the OnyxNatLangCache by shutting down 
 several OEAS COM+ applications on the application server. The next time 
 you log on to OEAS, the new National Language strings will be refreshed 
 in the cache. For more information, see <a href="../2.OEAS Features/ar_ca_natlangoverview.htm">National Language</a>.</p>
