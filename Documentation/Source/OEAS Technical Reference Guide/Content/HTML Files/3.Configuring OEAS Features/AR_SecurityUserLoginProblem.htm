        <h3>Security troubleshooting </h3>
        <p>The following sections describe problems that might occur for users, 
 and how you can solve them. </p>
        <h4>Membership in Windows roles </h4>
        <p>If you have problems with membership of roles after installation, correct 
 the membership using Component Services in Windows 2000. </p>
        <h4>OEAS logical application cannot connect to OEDB </h4>
        <p>If at any point you restore the database from a backup, OEAS logical 
 applications might not be able to connect to the OEDB. The cause is a 
 known SQL Server problem, in which user logon information is not preserved 
 when a database is restored from its backup. For prevention of or a solution 
 to the problem, see article Q168001 (“PRB: User Logon and/or Permission 
 Errors After Restoring Dump”) in the Microsoft Developers Network (MSDN) 
 Knowledge Base. </p>
        <h4>User logon problems </h4>
        <p>Some causes of user logon problems are specific either to integrated 
 Windows authentication or to Onyx authentication. Others are independent 
 of the kind of user authentication being employed. </p>
        <p>In addition to checking the items that are specific 
 to either kind of user authentication, check the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the AppName parameter or the SiteID parameter 
 is specified in the URL on which the user logs on, make sure that they 
 match the OEAS logical application name and the site ID in the Onyx Enterprise 
 Studio Web site on which you have added the user. The system does not 
 check these parameters.</li>
            <li>If two or more Onyx Enterprise Application Server 
 (OEAS) logical applications have been configured on one OEAS server, confirm 
 that the OnyxEASApp component was shut down after the last configuration. 
 If multiple OEAS logical applications are installed on one OEAS server, 
 the OnyxEASApp component must be shut down before anyone can logon to 
 the OEAS logical application.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the user is trying to log on with integrated Windows 
 authentication and gets the log on error message “Access Denied. Please 
 contact your System Administrator,” then check the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure the user is has been created correctly 
 in Security Administration: </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Sec_List">Verify that the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Windows 
 Integrated Authentication</span> box is checked.</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">Verify that the domain account typed in the 
 <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Domain Account</span> box is a valid, existing account.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Check that the Windows account with which the 
 user is logged in to his or her computer is the same as domain account 
 that is typed in the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Domain Account</span> box in 
 the edit area for the user.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the user is trying to log on with Onyx authentication 
 and gets the logon error message “Invalid User ID and/or password,” check 
 the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure the user is has been created correctly 
 in Security Administration. In this case, doing so means verifying that 
 the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Onyx Authentication</span> box is checked.</li>
            <li>Verify the user is using the correct User ID and 
 password to log on.</li>
        </ul>
