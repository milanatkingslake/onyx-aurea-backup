        <h3>Creating method calls for merge templates </h3>
        <p>The Templates feature uses method calls to support merge templates. 
 The purpose of a merged template is to accept an input record ID (such 
 as for a customer, company, individual, work ticket, or incident record) 
 and return data based on that record for insertion into the template. 
 Method calls used for merge templates are based on retrieval methods (retrieve, 
 retrieveCollection, and retrieveList), as opposed to insert, update, delete, 
 and saveCollection methods. </p>
        <p>Additionally, method calls for merge templates should 
 be able to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accept an input parameter that is the primary 
 ID of an input record.</li>
            <li>Return one or more outputs (to be merged into 
 the template).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can create method calls for merge templates using the Method Call 
 Designer, a design tool of OES. For more information about creating method 
 calls for merge templates, see <a href="../2.OEAS Features/AR_CA_MethCall.htm">Method calls</a>. 
 For information about using Method Call Designer see <i>Method Call Designer Help</i>.</p>
