        <h3>Configuring currency conversion data </h3>
        <p>OEAS uses currency conversion data to calculate currency conversions 
 between two different currency codes. How this calculation is performed 
 is explained in detail in <i>Currency 
 conversion processing</i>. </p>
        <p>The installation CD includes the file CurrencyConversion.dat. This is 
 a tab-delimited text file that contains all combinations of currency conversions 
 for the entire list of currencies that are included in the currency domain 
 data by default on installation of the OEDB. You can use the data of this 
 file as a reference point to help you understand how currency conversion 
 is performed, and to give you a starting point for downloading current 
 conversion rates. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">You can use the SQL Server BCP utility to copy this file 
 into the currency_conversion table. </p>
        <p>In the CurrencyConversion.dat file, all conversion rates are set to 
 1.0000000, and can be replaced with accurate data prior to implementing 
 OEAS in a production environment. </p>
