        <h3>Configuring email monitor subsystems to process inbound mail </h3>
        <p>Inbound email messages are sent to configured mailboxes on designated 
 network mail servers where they are monitored (at predefined intervals) 
 by email monitor subsystems (EMSs). EMSs run within the Onyx Processing 
 Server (OPS) framework. </p>
        <p>EMSs process and assimilate email into OEAS. You can 
 configure them to monitor the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A corporate email account such as a generic sales, 
 service, or support inbox. </li>
            <li>An email account set up in conjunction with the 
 Onyx Email for Outlook inbox. Onyx Email for Outlook is a plug-in for 
 Microsoft Outlook with which users can save messages into the database 
 from their personal Outlook inboxes and track new messages sent from their 
 personal account in OEP. For more information, see the <a href="../2.OEAS Features/ar_ca_emailfeature.htm">Email</a> 
 feature.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The EMS does not support Exchange Server users with identical 
 aliases &#160;If 
 Active Directory has two or more users with an identical Exchange Server 
 alias, OEP-Offline synchronization for the alias fails. However, EMS supports 
 external aliases (contact aliases) that are identical to OEP-Offline user 
 aliases.</p>
        <p>OPS Administration is an administration tool that 
 interacts with OPS and OEAS. You use this tool to configure and monitor 
 the OPS service and EMSs. OPS Administration enables you to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add, configure, and delete EMSs and monitored 
 mailboxes.</li>
            <li>Start, stop, pause, or continue the OPS service 
 and EMSs.</li>
            <li>Activate and deactivate EMSs and monitored mailboxes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Installing OPS and configuring EMSs and monitored mailboxes</h4>
        <p>The following tasks are required before you can begin 
 configuring EMSs for your company: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Install and configure OPS. This involves planning 
 how many EMSs your business needs dictate.</li>
            <li>For more information, see material on installing and configuring the Onyx Processing Server in the OEAS Installation Guide.</li>
            <li>Configure OPS security and user permissions.</li>
        </ul>

 Processing Server?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Configure EMSs and monitored mailboxes to process 
 inbound email. </li>
        </ul>
