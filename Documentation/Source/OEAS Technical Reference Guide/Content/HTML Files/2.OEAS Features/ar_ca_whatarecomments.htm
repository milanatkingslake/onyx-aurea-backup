        <h3>What are comments? </h3>
        <p>A comment is associated with a customer record. It consists of user-entered 
 text that enables end-users to record information about customers. For 
 example, a comment could include a customer’s opinion “liked the training 
 seminar” or judgment “voted against the initiative.” Additionally, a comment 
 could include more personal customer information, such as a customer’s 
 preference “prefers to stay at the Waldorf” or their family members’ names. 
 </p>
        <p>When working with comments, consider the following: 
 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>An end-user can create, update, or delete comments.</li>
            <li>Any type of information can be entered in a comment 
 (preferences, opinions, judgments, evaluations, and so forth).</li>
            <li>A customer record can contain many comments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Example:<span style="x-text-overline: off;x-text-line-through: off;text-decoration: none none none;"> 
 Using comments to record personal interactions with customers</span></p>
        <p>Following are examples of how comments can be used to record customer 
 information. </p>
        <p>After interacting with a customer: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>An airline reservationist could create the following 
 comment for a customer with special needs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1"><span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Title</span>: Needs special assistance<br /><span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Comment</span>: This customer has a broken foot 
 and will need assistance boarding the aircraft and meeting a connecting 
 flight. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A sales representative for a cosmetics company 
 could create the following comment for a customer with allergies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1"><span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Title</span>: Allergies<br /><span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Comment</span>: This customer is highly allergic 
 to scented products and products containing lanolin. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A personnel manager for a symphony orchestra could 
 create the following comment for a featured artist.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1"><span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Title</span>: Order Steinway concert grand<br /><span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Comment</span>: This artist prefers Steinway 
 but will use Bösendorfer if unavailable. Tuning required before each performance: 
 9/27, 9/28, 9/29. </p>
        <p>When an end-user brings up the customer record they can refer to the 
 comments already entered, and they can choose to edit or delete them. 
 Knowing what the previous comments were for a customer enables end-users 
 to make informed decisions and to provide appropriate responses. </p>
