        <h3>What is a survey? </h3>
        <p>A survey that you create with the Survey feature is a set of questions 
 that might have a hierarchical structure, and the responses associated 
 with those questions. When respondents take the survey, their answers 
 are associated with both the questions and the respondents. </p>
