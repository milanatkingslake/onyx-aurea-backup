        <h2>Products </h2>
        <p>Within Onyx Enterprise Application Server (OEAS), 
 products is a general term that encompasses three different kinds of products: 
 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Standard products</li>
            <li>Literature products</li>
            <li>Incident products</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These three types of products are domain data for three separate features 
 of OEAS. The following descriptions of these products are based on the 
 default implementation of OEAS. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Standard Products -</b> Standard products, 
 are used to complete customer products, forecasts, and quotes. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Literature products -</b> Literature 
 products are used to create literature order objects. Literature products 
 are special types of standard products that have additional functional 
 attributes such as the ability for the product to be sent directly to 
 a printer. You add these additional attributes to a standard 
 product in Product Administration, in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Literature 
 Information</span> data cell for the product. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Literature products are also used to create customer product, 
 and forecast and quote records. However, in the context of the Customer 
 Products feature, the additional functional attributes of the literature 
 product are ignored.</p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Incident products -</b> Incident products 
 are used to facilitate tracking and categorization of incidents and work 
 tickets. You create incident products separately from standard products 
 and literature products, and you can use them independent of the other 
 products. Optionally, you can relate one or more standard products to 
 an incident product using Product Administration. Doing so facilitates 
 tracking the incidents as they relate to actual products. </p>
        <p>The following illustration demonstrates the three types of products 
 and the OEAS features they support. </p>
        <p class="Image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/AR_ProductTypes.jpg" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #000000;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #000000;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #000000;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #000000;" />
        </p>
        <p>OEAS enables you to organize your standard products and literature products 
 by product families or groups, which can benefit companies with large 
 product offerings. Incident products are organized by incident category 
 types (sales, service, support, and work ticket). </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Standard products, including those with literature 
 attributes, are included in customer product records. </li>
            <li>Customer products can have any number of internal 
 or external contacts.</li>
            <li>Customer products can have any number of file 
 attachments.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Sec_List">A standard product can be associated with any 
 number of forecast or quote line items.</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">Standard products, including those with literature 
 attributes, can be associated with any number of customer product, and 
 forecast and quote records.</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">A literature product can be associated with any 
 number of literature order line items.</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">An incident product can be related to any number 
 of incidents that are of the same incident category as the incident product.</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">A work ticket (category) incident product can 
 be related to any number of work tickets.</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">A literature product can be associated with any 
 number of other literature products as a “label product” when its “is 
 label” flag is set to true.</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">A standard product can be associated with any 
 number of tags.</li>
        </ul>
