        <h4>Step 5: Customer replies to the sales representative </h4>
        <p>The individual customer sends a reply to the sales representative’s 
 personal email account, requesting a phone call to discuss the purchase. 
 The sales representative uses one of the menu options on the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Save 
 in Onyx</span> toolbar to record and track the email in the database. 
 </p>
        <p>In OEAS: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The email is forwarded to the monitored mailbox 
 created for Onyx Email for Outlook.</li>
            <li>EMS finds the email message and assimilates it 
 into OEAS.</li>
            <li>EMS uses the tracking information in the message 
 to create a link to the email thread and to create the non-contact associations 
 to the customer and incident records.</li>
            <li>EMS uses the sender and recipient names included 
 with the email to create contact associations for the individual and the 
 sales representative (internal user).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the end-user interface: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The individual’s reply email message appears on 
 the individual, company, and sales incident history pages and in the email 
 thread view.</li>
        </ul>
