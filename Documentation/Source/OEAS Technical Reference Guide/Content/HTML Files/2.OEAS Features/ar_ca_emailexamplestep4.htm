        <h4>Step 4: Sales manager sends a reply to the sales representative </h4>
        <p>The sales manager (the <span style="font-weight: bold;">bcc</span> 
 recipient) has a comment for the sales representative, and does the following: 
 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creates a reply message in Outlook.</li>
            <li>On the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Save in Onyx</span> 
 toolbar, chooses <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Save on Send</span> so that the 
 email is recorded and tracked in the database.</li>
            <li>Sends the email to the sales representative.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In OEAS: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The email is forwarded to the monitored mailbox 
 created for Onyx Email for Outlook.</li>
            <li>EMS finds the email message and assimilates it 
 into OEAS.</li>
            <li>EMS uses the tracking information in the message 
 to create a link to the email thread. The tracking information is also 
 used to create the non-contact associations to the individual, company, 
 and incident records that were created for the previous email.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the end-user interface: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The managerâ€™s reply email message appears on the 
 individual, company, and sales incident history pages and in the email 
 thread view.</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
