        <h4>Method calls </h4>
        <p>A method call is a data-driven wrapper for a logical business object 
 method and defined set of input and output parameters. You use the Method 
 Call Designer to define the method call, then use the Script Designer 
 to associate it with a script step. </p>
        <p>You can call a method that returns a value to the script, manipulates 
 data elsewhere in the OEDB, or triggers another event, such as sending 
 an email. A series of method calls can be associated with a single step. 
 </p>
        <p>A method call is either a pre step method call or 
 a post step method call, depending on when it is carried out in relation 
 to a script step: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pre step method calls are carried out at the beginning 
 of a step, before data is sent to the Web page that the end-user sees. 
 You can use them to populate variable lists of possible responses in certain 
 kinds of prompts.</li>
            <li>Post step method calls are carried out after a 
 step has been saved and before the variables are updated and the branching 
 rules are evaluated. Post method calls are often used to set variable 
 values for evaluation in condition statements. You can also use post method 
 calls to manipulate data in the OEDB.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can create method calls for OEAS methods that 
 accept as input either a single object or simple (non-object) data types. 
 The following method types generally fit this description: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>custom</li>
            <li>delete</li>
            <li>insert</li>
            <li>retrieve</li>
            <li>retrieveCollection </li>
            <li>retrieveList</li>
            <li>update</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Within scripting, method calls support use of the saveCollection method. 
 The number of items in the collection is fixed when the method call is 
 designed. For example, a method call that is designed to save two phone 
 numbers always saves two phone numbers. You can not use it to save three 
 phone numbers or a single phone number. </p>
        <p>For objects that have properties containing collections of other objects, 
 method calls can save the top-level object and a fixed number of objects 
 in each child collection. The number of items to be saved in each child 
 collection is fixed with the design of the method call. For instance, 
 you can design a method call to save a company with three phone numbers 
 and two addresses. But such a method call must be bound to scripting variables 
 containing three phone numbers and two addresses. </p>
        <p>Regarding output values, method calls can use XPath queries and list 
 outputs to return data. For example, you can call company.retrieve and 
 return data from the company and any of the phones within the company's 
 phones collection. </p>
