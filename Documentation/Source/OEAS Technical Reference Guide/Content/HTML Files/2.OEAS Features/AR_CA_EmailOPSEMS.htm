        <h4>Email monitor subsystems </h4>
        <p>Inbound email messages are sent to configured mailboxes on designated 
 network mail servers where they are monitored (at predefined intervals) 
 by email monitor subsystems (EMSs). EMSs process and save inbound email 
 messages into OEAS. They run within the Onyx Processing Server (OPS) framework. 
 </p>
        <p>OPS consists of the OPS service, OPS subsystems, and OPS Administration. 
 The OPS service controls the subsystems, which perform processing tasks. 
 Another primary function of the OPS service is to communicate with the 
 OPS Administration tool. You use OPS Administration to manage and configure 
 EMSs and stop, start, pause, and resume the OPS service and EMSs. </p>
        <p>An EMS calls OEAS business object methods to resolve the recipient and 
 the sender email addresses of an inbound email. When processing an inbound 
 email that is part of a thread, the EMS retrieves the associations of 
 the original email. </p>
        <p>To insert an inbound email into the OEDB, the EMS 
 groups multiple method calls into an actionBatchXml string. The EMS makes 
 a single call to the execute method of the actionBatch object to insert 
 the following objects: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The resolved recipients and sender as emailContact 
 objects</li>
            <li>The inbound email as an emailMessage object </li>
            <li>The associations of the thread's original email 
 message as association objects for the new inbound email message (if the 
 new message is part of a thread)</li>
            <li>The attachments as fileLink objects (if any exist)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information, see material on the actionBatch business object.
 </p>
        <h4>Installing OPS and configuring EMSs and monitored mailboxes</h4>
        <p>For OEP email processing purposes, the Onyx administrator 
sets up OPS and an EMS by: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Installing and configuring OPS</li>
            <li>Configuring OPS security and user permissions</li>
            <li>Configuring EMSs and monitored mailboxes to process 
 inbound email</li>
        </ul>
