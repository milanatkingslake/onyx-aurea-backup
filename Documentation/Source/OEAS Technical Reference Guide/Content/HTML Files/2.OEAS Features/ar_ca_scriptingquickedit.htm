        <h4>Quick Edit </h4>
        <p>When you design a script, you can specify whether Quick Edit is allowed 
 for that script. </p>
        <p>Quick Edit allows the end-user to go back and edit the responses starting 
 from a previous step without reevaluating the branching rules based on 
 the newly entered data. The end-user can return from that step to the 
 end of the script without potentially branching off to a new step. When 
 editing a previous step, however, the end-user can choose to reevaluate 
 the branching rules based on the newly entered data. If the end-user chooses 
 to reevaluate the branching rules, all the previously completed steps 
 that follow the edited step are discarded. </p>
        <p>If Quick Edit is not allowed, then the rules are always reevaluated 
 based on any newly entered data. All steps after the edited step in the 
 completed steps list are discarded. </p>
        <p>To avoid losing data when steps in the completed steps list are discarded, 
 store the prompt responses in global variables and use the same name for 
 the prompts input and output variables. The values of the variables are 
 then retained even when steps are discarded and are used as the default 
 values for the prompts should the end-user revisit a discarded step. </p>
