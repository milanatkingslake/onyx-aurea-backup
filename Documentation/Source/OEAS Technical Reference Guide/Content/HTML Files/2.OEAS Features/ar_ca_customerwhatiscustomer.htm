        <h2>Customers </h2>
        <p>The Onyx Enterprise Application Server (OEAS) is comprised of numerous 
 CRM features and, because OEAS is designed primarily to help you manage, 
 maintain, and support your customer relationship management (CRM) activities, 
 nearly all of these features are either directly or indirectly related 
 to the Customer feature. </p>
        <p>There are two types of customers: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Companies</li>
            <li>Individuals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In general, multiple individuals are logically related to one company 
 since there are many individuals working for one company. With OEAS, you 
 have the flexibility to enter separate data for both companies and individuals, 
 as well as to establish relationships between them. </p>
        <p>The following graphic depicts how customers relate to other functional 
 areas of the application. </p>
        <p>In the default OEAS implementation, customers can own customer product, 
 incident, and literature order records, and you can relate customers to 
 each other in two ways: you can relate a single individual to a company 
 as that company™s primary contact, and you can relate a company to any 
 number of individuals. By establishing relationships between companies 
 and individuals, you can quickly access information about a company, its 
 employees and their job titles. </p>
