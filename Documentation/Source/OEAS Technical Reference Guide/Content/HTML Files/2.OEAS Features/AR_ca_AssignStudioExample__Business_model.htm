        <h4>Sample business model</h4>
        <p><span>This sample business model provides an overview of the common 
 configurations of territories, conditions, expressions and assignment 
 sets in the Assignment Studio.</span>
        </p>
        <h5>Who are we?</h5>
        <p>Global Widget, Inc. is a west coast business 
 that sells Widgets and the super Giga-Widget to other companies. Sales 
 opportunities are gathered from a number of sources and entered by people 
 unfamiliar with the details of the companies’ sales organization. However, 
 Global Widget requires face-to-face contact with their customers in order 
 to make an effective sales pitch. </p>
        <p>The company has two regional sales offices: 
 one in Seattle, Washington and the other in Sacramento, California. Each 
 regional sales office includes an account manager and a senior sales executive 
 as well as a team of sales people.</p>
        <h5>How do we sell?</h5>
        <p>The sales people all work for commissions. For 
 fairness, new leads are distributed to the pool of sales people using 
 the Round Robin assignment type. There is a complication -- only the senior 
 sales executive is allowed to work with sales opportunities for the rare 
 but valuable Giga-Widget product. The regional account manager is the 
 internal contact for each company and sales incident.</p>
        <h5>After the sale, support steps in</h5>
        <p>Global Widget also provides its customers with 
 a support organization. The support organization consists of two teams: 
 Team A is the front-line personnel and Team B is the senior support engineers. 
 Team A has the ability to escalate incidents to Team B (senior-level engineers), 
 when they are unable to solve the issue in a timely manner. </p>

 that translates business rules for Global Widget into territories, conditions, 
 expressions, and assignment sets in the Assignment Studio.</p>

        <h5>Choosing processes</h5>
        <p>After the territory assignment structure is 
 defined, the administrator enables OPM processes for the evaluation of 
 the assignment conditions. For Global Widget, processes are required for 
 the insert and update of incidents and companies.</p>
        <p>Step 1: The administrator considers how company 
 or individual records will be inserted or updated by employees.</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li class="List_Indent">Global Widget, Inc. is a business-to-business 
 operation. Sales people interact with companies but not individuals. Employees 
 create and update customer records on a daily basis. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Best practice</span>: The business 
 rules do not include individual data. A company territory is defined and 
 the company insert process is enabled. </p>
        <p>Step 2: The administrator considers how <a href="AR_ca_AssignStudioincidentterritories.htm">incidents 
 are tracked and assigned to leads</a>.</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li class="List_Indent">Global Widget requires the ability to track incoming 
 incidents on a daily basis. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Best practice</span>: The rules 
 do not include customers. An incident territory is defined and the incident 
 insert process is enabled. Since the rules for handling incidents do not 
 include customer properties, there is no need to enable the customer update 
 process. Only combined territories will require the customer update process.</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li class="List_Indent">When support engineers are unable to resolve incidents 
 in a timely manner, they need the ability to re-assign incidents to senior-level 
 support engineers. In this case, incidents are re-assigned to the Auto 
 Assign user. The senior-level support engineers are created as an assignment 
 set for the Auto Assign user in Assignment Administration. For more information, 
 see the <a href="ar_ca_assignstudioaboutproccond.htm">Manual assignment 
 of incidents</a>. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Best practice</span>: The rules 
 include only incident data, however, the escalation occurs when an incident 
 is updated. Territories are defined and the incident insert and update 
 processes are enabled.</p>
