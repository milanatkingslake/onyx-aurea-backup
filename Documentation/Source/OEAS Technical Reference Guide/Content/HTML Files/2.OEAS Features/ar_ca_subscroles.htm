        <h4>Subscription roles </h4>
        <p>Subscription roles are created using Subscription Designer, where you 
 assign an organizational role (as defined in Security Administration) 
 to a subscription relationship. They enable you to assign a subscription 
 rule to the organizational role so that you can override the default subscription 
 behavior for subscribers who are members of that role. </p>
        <p>You can assign the following subscription rules to 
 a subscription role: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Subscribe primary object and cascade its subscription 
 relationships.</li>
            <li>Subscribe secondary object and cascade its subscription 
 relationships.</li>
            <li>Cascade only the secondary objects that meet this 
 filter expression.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Example: </p>
        <p>Suppose your organization has offline users from both 
 the Support team and the Sales team and that these end-users only want 
 to take the incident records offline that are relevant to their activities. 
 The solution is to create separate subscription rules for these two groups 
 such that when they subscribe to a company or individual, cascaded subscriptions 
 for the support and sales incidents are created for them depending on 
 whether they are part of the support or sales team. You could apply this 
 solution by using Security Administration to create the Support role and 
 the Sales role and adding the support and sales users to these roles respectively 
 and then setting the rules for those roles in Subscription Designer, as 
 follows: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Locate the <em class="Emphasis">company owner of 
 an incident</em> relationship for the subscribable incident object and: 
 </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Sec_List">Add a new subscription role to the relationship 
 based on the previously created Security Administration Support role, 
 and set the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Cascade only the secondary objects that 
 meet this filter expression </span>rule to “iCategoryId=1.”</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">Add a second new subscription role to the 
 relationship based on the previously created Security Administration Sales 
 role, and set the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Cascade only the secondary objects 
 that meet this filter expression </span>rule to “iCategoryId=3.”</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Locate the <em class="Emphasis">individual owner 
 of an incident</em> relationship for the subscribable incident object, 
 and again:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Sec_List">Add a new subscription role to the relationship 
 based on the previously created Security Administration Support role, 
 and set the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Cascade only the secondary objects that 
 meet this filter expression </span>rule to “iCategoryId=1.”</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">Add a second new subscription role to the 
 relationship based on the previously created Security Administration Sales 
 role, and set the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Cascade only the secondary objects 
 that meet this filter expression </span>rule to “iCategoryId=3.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With this solution, when a member of the Support team subscribes to 
 a company or individual, cascaded subscriptions are created for that user 
 to only the support incidents (and any related objects of those incidents 
 for which cascade rules apply). And when a member of the Sales team subscribes 
 to a company or individual, cascaded subscriptions are created for that 
 user to only the sales incidents (and any related objects of those incidents 
 for which cascade rules apply). </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">You can also use a subscription role to ensure that certain 
 objects are not subscribed to members of a particular role. For instance, 
 suppose you have a subscription relationship between the company and incident 
 objects with the Cascade the secondary object and cascade its subscription 
 relationships rule set to true. In this case, end-users who subscribe 
 to a company have cascaded subscriptions to that company’s incidents. 
 However, if you had a certain group of people (organizational role) for 
 whom you did not want cascaded subscriptions to the incidents, you could 
 create a subscription role for that group, leaving the Cascade the secondary 
 object and cascade its subscription relationships rule set to false. This 
 would prevent the cascaded subscriptions to the incidents for this group 
 of users.</p>
