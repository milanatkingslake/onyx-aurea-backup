        <h3>OEAS method types that support method calls </h3>
        <p>The Method Calls feature supports creating method calls based on all 
 of the standard OEAS methods as well as any custom methods you might have 
 created. However, the Templates OEAS feature supports only retrieve, retrieveCollection, 
 and retrieveList method calls. </p>
        <p class="Important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"> In general, method calls can call methods that persist 
 collections of objects (saveCollection methods). However, the behavior 
 of these methods (within the context of the method call) is limited. For 
 more information, see <a href="AR_CA_MethCallGdColl.htm">Collections</a>.</p>
