        <h3>Elements of a survey </h3>
        <p>The main elements of a survey are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Question</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">A question is a prompt whose purpose is to obtain information from 
 respondents. A question is not associated with a survey. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Survey question</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">A survey question is an instance of a question that is associated 
 with a survey. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Response</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">A response is a possible answer for a question. A response is not 
 associated with a question. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Question response</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">A question response is an instance of a response that is associated 
 with a survey question. </p>
        <p class="Indent1">You can make a response editable. When a respondent selects an editable 
 response, he or she can add text to the response. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Question hierarchy</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">A question hierarchy is a structure that links question responses 
 to subsequent survey questions, thus determining which survey questions 
 are asked and in what order. </p>
        <p class="Indent1">Creating a question hierarchy is optional; if you don’t create one, 
 the survey questions are presented according to their list order in the 
 survey in Survey Administration. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Answer</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">An answer is a respondent’s composition or choice of response (or 
 responses) for a survey question. </p>
        <p class="Indent1">For free-text questions and editable responses, the respondent can 
 compose his or her own text. An example of an editable response is, “Other,” 
 to which a respondent to add particulars. </p>
        <p class="Indent1">In addition to free-text questions, there are multiple-type and 
 single-type questions. For answers to single-type questions, the respondent 
 can only select one question response. For multiple-type questions, the 
 respondent can select more than one question response. </p>
        <p>When a respondent completes a survey, the answers 
 are associated with that respondent. As a result: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the respondent takes that survey again, those 
 answers overwrite the answers chosen or written the first time he or she 
 took the survey. </li>
            <li>If the respondent takes two surveys that each 
 have a survey question that is an instance of the same question, the respondent’s 
 answer to the survey question in the second survey overwrites his or her 
 answer to the survey question in the first survey.</li>
        </ul>
