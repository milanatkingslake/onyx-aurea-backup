        <h1>Combining role-specific rules during cascade </h1>
        <p>There are several scenarios to consider when you have 
 created role-based rules for subscription relationships: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>An OEP end-user can be a member of an organizational 
 role that is associated with more than one subscription relationship.</li>
            <li>An OEP end-user can be a member of more than one 
 organizational role and, as such, can be included in more than one subscription 
 role.</li>
            <li>The rule set for a subscription role overrides 
 the same rule set for the subscription relationship for members of that 
 role.</li>
            <li>An OEP end-user who is associated with multiple 
 subscription roles for the same subscription relationship is subscribed 
 to a union of all of the subscribable records based on those roles.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following example demonstrates how these scenarios are combined 
 for cascaded subscriptions. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Example </p>
        <p>Suppose you have four OEP end-users who belong to the following organizational 
 roles, and for whom you have created subscription profiles for OEP-Offline. 
 </p>

        </p>
        <p>Suppose that you also have the following subscribable 
 objects and the following subscription rules set for those subscribable 
 objects: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>individual</li>
            <li>incident</li>
            <li>task</li>
            <li>forecast</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>incident </h3>
        <p class="Image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/AR_SubscRoleScenario_1.jpg" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #000000;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #000000;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #000000;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #000000;" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">task </p>
        <p class="Image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/AR_SubscRoleScenario_2.jpg" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #000000;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #000000;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #000000;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #000000;" />
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">forecast </p>
        <p class="Image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/AR_SubscRoleScenario_3.jpg" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #000000;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #000000;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #000000;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #000000;" />
        </p>
        <p>Note that for this example: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>There is only a requirement that there be an individual 
 subscribable object. There are no subscription relationships defined for 
 individual, as the only relationships required for this example exist 
 on the secondary object (incident).</li>
            <li>Subscription roles exist only for the incident 
 object’s <em class="Emphasis">individual owner of an incident</em> relationship 
 and the task object’s <em class="Emphasis">incident owner of a task</em> 
 relationship. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Based on the subscribable objects, relationships, rules, and roles described 
 above, the following end-user interactions result in the cascaded subscriptions 
 described: </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">User 1 subscribes to an individual </p>
        <ul>
            <li>User 1 belongs to the A organizational role, which 
 is not associated with a subscription role. </li>
            <li>Relationship rules are used to determine cascaded 
 subscriptions. No role-based rules are used. </li>
            <li>The Cascade secondary object and cascade its subscription 
 relationships is set to true for all subscription relationships, so subscriptions 
 are cascaded recursively for the incidents owned by the subscribed individual, 
 and the tasks and forecasts owned by those subscribed incidents.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ListNote" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">This scenario would be the same for any subscriber who was 
 not a member of an organizational role.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">User 2 subscribes to an individual </p>
        <ul>
            <li>User 2 belongs to the B organizational role, which 
 is associated with a subscription role on the incident <em class="Emphasis">individual 
 owner of an incident</em> relationship.</li>
            <li>The rules on this subscription role are set to 
 false. </li>
            <li>The false setting for <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Subscribe 
 to secondary object and cascade its subscription relationships</span> 
 overrides the true setting for this rule that is set at the relationship 
 level. Because of this, no secondary incidents are subscribed to User 
 2 during the cascade. </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">User 3 subscribes to an individual </p>
        <ul>
            <li>User 3 belongs to the B and C organizational roles, 
 which are each associated with a subscription role on the incident <em class="Emphasis">individual owner of an incident</em> relationship.</li>
            <li>The rules on the subscription role associated 
 with role B are set to false, and the false setting for <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Subscribe 
 to secondary object and cascade its subscription relationships</span> 
 overrides the true setting for this rule that is set at the relationship 
 level. </li>
            <li>On the subscription role associated with role 
 C, <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Subscribe to secondary object and cascade its 
 subscription relationships</span> is set to true, with an additional filter 
 criteria set to iIncidentCategory=1. </li>
            <li>Based on a union of these rules, subscriptions 
 for User 3 are cascaded recursively to the “support” type incidents owned 
 by the subscribed individual, and the tasks and forecasts related to those 
 incidents.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">User 4 subscribes to an individual </p>
        <ul>
            <li>User 4 belongs to the B, C, and D organizational 
 roles, which are each associated with a subscription role on the incident 
 <em class="Emphasis">individual owner of an incident</em> relationship.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Sec_List">The rules on the subscription role associated 
 with role B are set to false, and the false setting for <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Subscribe

            <li class="Sec_List">On the subscription role associated with role

        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Based on a union of these rules, subscriptions
