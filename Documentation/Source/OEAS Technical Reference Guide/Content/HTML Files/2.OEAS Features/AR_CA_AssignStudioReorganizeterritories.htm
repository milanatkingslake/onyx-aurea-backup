        <h3>Reorganizing territories</h3>
        <p>Business rules change and evolve over time, 
 and in the Assignment Studio this development translates into changes 
 within the structure of the Assignment Tree 
 or the logic of the expressions that define conditions within the tree. 
 To support evolving businesses, the Assignment Studio offers a way to 
 update the company or individual associations within a territory using 
 List Manager.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;">List Manager is a tool 
 used for bulk processing of OEP records and for generating lists of customers, 
 and you can use this tool for maintaining territories. In List Manager, 
 you can:</span>
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Query the customer's assigned 
 territory.</li>
            <li>Re-assign companies and 
 individuals to new territories.</li>
            <li>Retire a territory, either 
 by deleting its customer data or by moving the data into a new territory.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following example reorganizes a geographic 
 territory by re-assigning companies and individuals to a new territory. 
 For further instructions on List Manager, see the <span style="font-style: italic;">OEP 
 Help and </span>"FAQ" in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Assignment 
 Administration Help</span>.</p>
        <h4>Example: Reorganizing a geographic territory</h4>
        <p>A Western sales region in the United States needs to put the state of 
 California into its own sales territory. Customers with California addresses 
 must be re-assigned into the new territory.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To make these changes, the administrator:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Creates a new California 
 territory separate from the Western sales region in the Assignment Tree. 
 New customers with addresses in California are associated with this territory. 
 </li>
            <li>Re-assigns all companies 
 and individuals with California addresses currently associated with the 
 Western sales region to the new sales territory. <span style="margin-left: 0px;">To 
 accomplish this task, the administrator chooses all companies with a California 
 address and then runs the "Reassign Territory" bulk action in 
 List Manager. When the bulk action is complete, the administrator repeats 
 this procedure with individuals.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Considerations</h4>
        <p>When you reorganize territories, consider the following:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>The “Reassign Territory” 
 bulk action only supports the update of company records or individual 
 records (not a combination of both). </li>
            <li>Re-assignment of customers 
 is required. For more information, see <a href="AR_ca_AssignStudioincidentterritories.htm">Creating 
 incident territories</a>. </li>
        </ul>
