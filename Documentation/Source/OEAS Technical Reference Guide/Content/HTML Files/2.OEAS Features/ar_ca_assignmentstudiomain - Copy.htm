        <h1>Assignment Studio</h1>
        <p>Assignment Studio is the collection of <MadCap:variable name="CCM variables.Tier - middle" />, <MadCap:variable name="CCM variables.Component - OES" />, and Business Rules Manager (BRM) functionality 
 that provides territory and lead management for OEP.</p>
        <p class="Note">Documentation on integration between Assignment Studio and BRM is currently not available.</p>
        <p>Assignment Studio is comprised of the following components:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>
                Assignment Administration
                
                    <p>The OES Assignment Administration tool is the main feature of Assignment 
 Studio, that enables you to define and implement simple 
 conditions (rules) that are used to do the following:
 </p><p>With this tool, you can:</p><ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc"><li>Define a territory assignment structure (hierarchy) 
 that matches your organization's business rules for assigning leads</li><li>Automatically create internal contacts for company, 
 individual, and incident records</li><li>Automatically assign incidents (sales opportunities, 
 service requests, and support incidents) to internal users</li><li>Assign companies and individuals to territories</li><li>Create contacts to associate with incident conditions</li></ul></li>
            <li>
                BRM Processes
                
                    <p>BRM is a system for designing and implementing business processes that 
 work in conjunction with OEAS. Assignment Studio conditions are evaluated 
 through several BRM processes.</p></li>
            <li>
                OEAS Business 
 Objects
                
                    <p>Assignment Studio business objects are responsible for providing information 
 to the BRM processes about internal contacts, incident assignments and 
 their related conditions.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Note">Assignment capabilities beyond those provided by Assignment 
 Studio can be accomplished in Business Rules Manager. Please contact <MadCap:variable name="CCM variables.Company CRM division" /> for additional details.</p>
