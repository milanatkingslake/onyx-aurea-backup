        <h3>Understanding the cascade process </h3>
        <p>Once a transactional object is marked for subscription, its subscription 
 status is tracked by the subscription_item table. This includes the objects 
 that a user explicitly subscribes to, unsubscribes from, or deletes, and 
 those objects to which the user has cascaded subscriptions, unsubscriptions, 
 and deletions because they are related to the aforementioned objects. 
 The information contained by the subscription_item table is then used 
 by the synchronization process to determine which OEAS records are to 
 be taken offline, refreshed to the offline database, or removed from the 
 offline database. A field in subscription_item called sync_action is used 
 to track the subscription status for each subscribed record. </p>
        <p>The following table describes the possible states of subscription as 
 determined by the subscription_item sync_action value. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Several of the subscription states are set by changes capture 
 triggers. For more information about these triggers, see <a href="ar_ca_subscchangecapt.htm">Change-capture 
 triggers</a>. </p>
