        <h2>Work Tickets </h2>
        <p>The Work Tickets feature can help users track activities 
 that are not directly related to companies and individuals. Using work 
 tickets, users can track and monitor: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Product enhancement requests made in the context 
 of routine sales, service, and support incidents. For instance, if a product 
 enhancement is requested a certain number of times, your engineering team 
 might want to consider incorporating the feature into the next release 
 of the product.</li>
            <li>Product errors or service shortcomings that are 
 discovered either internally or by customers.</li>
            <li>Employee requests for changes and improvements 
 to internal policies and processes. For instance, a user of Onyx Employee 
 Portal (OEP) might identify an aspect of the sales process that could 
 be automated more effectively or changed to improve customer satisfaction. 
 That user can request the change in a work ticket and the sales team can 
 track the change through design and implementation to resolution.</li>
            <li>Personal tasks, or tasks that must be completed 
 for multiple customers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that a work ticket: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can either exist independently or be associated 
 with any number of customers, incidents, and other work tickets.</li>
            <li>Can have any number of work note entries.</li>
            <li>Can have any number of audit-log entries.</li>
            <li>Can be associated with only one incident product.</li>
            <li>Can be owned by only one user.</li>
            <li>Can be associated with any number of users as 
 internal contacts.</li>
            <li>Can be associated with any number of tags.</li>
            <li>Can have any number of file attachments.</li>
        </ul>
