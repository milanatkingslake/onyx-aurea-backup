        <h2>Subscribers </h2>
        <p>Subscribers are OEP end-users who can subscribe to the records that 
 they want to copy to OEP-Offline. To enable an OEP end-user the ability 
 to subscribe to records, you must create that end-user a subscription 
 profile for OEP-Offline. Once you have created a subscription profile 
 for the end-user, he or she can subscribe to records. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Before you can create subscription profiles for OEP end-users, 
 you must define a staging server and configure your synchronization subsystem. 
 For more information, see the <span style="font-style: italic;">OEP-Offline 
 Implementation Guide</span>.</p>
        <p>The subscription profile also enables you to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Turn synchronization on or off for the user.</li>
            <li>Turn subscription on or off for the user.</li>
            <li>Reset the user’s existing offline data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">For more information about creating subscription profiles, 
 see <a href="../4.Using ONYX Enterprise Studio/oes_secadminmggsubscrprofs.htm">Managing subscription profiles</a>. </p>
        <p>In addition to enabling OEP end-users the ability to subscribe to records 
 themselves, you can create advanced subscribers—OEP end-users who can 
 subscribe to records on behalf of one or more offline users. For instance, 
 suppose that your account services director assigns new accounts (customers) 
 to his team of account managers. You can make your director an advanced 
 subscriber so that as he assigns the new customers, he can also subscribe 
 those customers to the managers to whom they belong. The next time the 
 managers synchronize their offline data, they automatically retrieve their 
 new accounts and can access them while they are disconnected from the 
 network. </p>
        <p>The general rules for advanced subscribers include 
 that: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>An advanced subscriber can subscribe subscribable 
 data to any number of offline users.</li>
            <li>An offline user can have any number of advanced 
 subscribers subscribe to data on their behalf. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">For more information about creating an advanced subscriber,
