        <h4>Email(1) </h4>
        <p>In the Global TelCom example, Email(1) is a templatized email that informs 
 the customer that the problem is being addressed and that they will be 
 contacted by the support technician assigned to them. The template uses 
 the merge functionality to include specific data pertinent to the support 
 request. In the following example of Email(1), the merged data is bolded 
 for clarification. </p>
        <p class="Image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/AR_TemplateExample2.jpg" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #000000;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #000000;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #000000;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #000000;" />
        </p>
        <p>The email is a merged template, with placeholders for the data that 
 is specific to this support request. The data is merged into the template 
 from OEAS via a method call. The template is created and maintained in 
 Onyx Employee Portal (OEP) using Template Maintenance, and the method 
 call is created using the Method Call Designer. </p>
        <p>This particular template is a merged template and 
 requires a method call based on the OEAS method incident.retrieveListQuickSearch. 
 Based on the ID of the support incident, it returns the following information: 
 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The customer’s ID (the “Owner ID” column of the 
 rowSet returned by the method)</li>
            <li>The customer’s first and last names (the “First 
 Name” and “Last Name” columns of the rowSet returned by the method)</li>
            <li>The support incident ID (the “ID” column of the 
 rowSet returned by the method)</li>
            <li>The name of the support technician to whom the 
 support incident is assigned (the “Assigned To” column of the rowSet returned 
 by the method)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you have created the necessary method call to support the template, 
 you can create the template using Template Maintenance, linking placeholders 
 for the merged data to the output details of the method call as appropriate. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">A method call based on the incident retrieveListQuickSearch 
 method is demonstrated in the section on Method Calls. See <i>retrieveList</i>. 
 That method call example retrieves data similar to that required of the 
 example template for Email(1).</p>
