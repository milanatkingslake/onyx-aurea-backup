        <h4>File share permissions </h4>
        <p>The following functionality needs read and write file 
 share permissions:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Onyx File Agent</li>
            <li>OnyxEmailSendStep component</li>
            <li>Email Monitor Subsystem</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Depending on which of these functions are required, the file share server 
 exposes a share that is secured with sufficient permissions to allow their 
 identities access to the files stored within. </p>
        <p>For attachments to work properly, the OnyxFileAgent COM+ identity user 
 must be a domain user and have read/write access to the share. </p>
        <p>OnyxEmailSendStep component stores email attachments on the file share 
 server. They are uploaded and stored using the <a href="Attachments_storage.htm">standard attachment process</a>, but 
 there is a difference when attachments are sent with emails. When a user 
 sends an email with one or more attachments, OEAS copies the attachment 
 file(s) from the share before sending all items to the outgoing mail server. 
 OEAS uses its local account (named OnyxEASUser by default) to access the 
 file share. If this account does not have permissions on the file share, 
 the send action fails. </p>
        <p>Email processed by the Email Monitoring Subsystem of OPS might also 
 have file attachments. When EMS creates Onyx Email Message records it 
 also imports the email attachments into the system, creating email attachment 
 and file link records for them and storing the file the same way that 
 OnyxFileAgent and the Email Send Step do. For this activity the OPS Service 
 User must also have access to the file share. If this account does not 
 have permissions on the file share, the EMS action will fail.</p>
        <p>If the file share is not on the same computer as the OEAS server, the 
 OEAS local account must have permission to read from the share. One way 
 to automatically give this required read permission is to replicate the 
 OEAS local account on the file share computer. Create an account on the 
 file share computer with an identical user name and password. Alternatively, 
 you can configure the OnyxEASUser as a domain account with appropriate 
 privileges on both servers.</p>
