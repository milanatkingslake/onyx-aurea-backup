        <h4>About processing conditions</h4>
        <p>Conditions contain expressions (logical statements) 
 that are processed by rules. The following example shows the United States 
 territory, its Washington territory, the HighTech condition, and the HighTechGroup 
 assignment set.</p>
        <p class="Image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/AR_Diagramrules.jpg" style="border: none;width: 347px;height: 193px;float: none;border-style: none;border-style: none;border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #000000;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #000000;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #000000;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #000000;" width="347" height="193" border="0" />
        </p>
        <p>Contained in the HighTech condition are the following 
 expressions:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>countryCode = US</li>
            <li>regionCode = WA</li>
            <li>marketSector = 1002</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The rule is: If countryCode = US and regionCode = WA and marketSector 
 = 1002 then create the assignments for the HighTechGroup. If the condition 
 evaluates to true (that is, if all of its expressions evaluate to true), 
 UserA is assigned to the incident. </p>
        <h4>Evaluating conditions</h4>
        <p>The Assignment Studio evaluates conditions in order, from the top to 
 the bottom of the Assignment Tree (navigation area). Through this sequence 
 of evaluation, a company, individual, or incident record is associated 
 with the first condition that evaluates to true, even when lower conditions 
 might also evaluate to true. </p>
        <p>When a condition evaluates to true, customer and incident records are 
 associated with the appropriate internal contacts, and incidents are reassigned 
 to the appropriate internal contacts, customers, and territories. Processing 
 runs in the background and is not visible to end users. </p>
        <p>Unlike the company and individual update process, the incident update 
 process is not configured to run on every incident update. For incidents, 
 the update process only runs when an OEP 
 user manually re-assigns an incident to a particular user called the Auto 
 Assign user. For more information, see <a href="AR_CA_AssignStudioManualassignmentincidents.htm">Manual 
 assignment of incidents</a>.</p>
        <p class="Warning" MadCap:autonum=" &#160;&#160;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">You can reorder processing of a territory's contained territories, 
 conditions, and expressions by using the <img src="../../Resources/Images/iconup0.jpg" style="border: none;border-style: none;float: none;width: 26px;height: 26px;" width="26" height="26" border="0" /> and <img src="../../Resources/Images/icondown0.jpg" style="border: none;border-style: none;float: none;width: 26px;height: 26px;" width="26" height="26" border="0" /> arrows on the toolbar to reposition items. For example, you 
 could reposition a high-priority condition, such as month long campaign 
 at the top of the list of conditions to ensure first priority for processing.</p>
        <h4>Assignment Studio business objects</h4>
        <p>Assignment Studio business objects are responsible for providing information 
 to the OPM processes about internal contacts, incident assignments and 
 their related conditions.</p>
        <h4>OPM processes</h4>
        <p>The Onyx Enterprise Dictionary (OED) calls the BRM processes for the 
 insert and update of companies, individuals, and incidents. You must enable 
 the steps to call whatever processes are appropriate for your business. 
 .

 business model</a>.</p>
        <p>About processing conditions</p>
        <p>The following end user workflow describes how conditions 
 are evaluated and processed through OEAS and OPM:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>The OEP user creates a company, individual, or 
 incident record and saves it to the Onyx database.</li>
            <li>At run time, the OPM process retrieves an ordered, 
 filtered list of expressions (grouped by condition) from OEAS.</li>
            <li>The OPM process finds the first condition that 
 is true for the record and stops evaluating the expressions. (A condition 
 is true when all of its expressions are true.)</li>
            <li>OPM associates new and updated records with the 
 territory that owns the condition.</li>
            <li>OPM assigns the incident and creates the correct 
 internal contact records.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Condition processing runs in the background and is not visible to end 
 users. </p>
