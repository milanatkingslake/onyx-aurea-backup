        <h4>Email(2) </h4>
        <p>In the Global TelCom example, Email(2) is a templatized email that informs 
 the customer that the problem has been resolved and that the support request 
 has been closed. It is intended to be a follow-up letter, following verbal 
 confirmation between the support technician and the customer. The template 
 uses the merge functionality to include specific data pertinent to the 
 support request. In the following example of Email(2), the merged data 
 is bolded for clarification. </p>
        <p class="Image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/AR_TemplateExample3.jpg" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #000000;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #000000;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #000000;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #000000;" />
        </p>
        <p>Again, the email is a merged template, with placeholders 
 for the specific support request data that you want to merge into the 
 template. In this case, the template uses the same method call as the 
 Email(1) template, based on the OEAS method incident.retrieveListQuickSearch. 
 That method call actually returns more data than is required for the Email(2) 
 template, but you simply create and link the placeholders (to the appropriate 
 output details of the method call) that are required. Based on the previously 
 created method call, the Email(2) template merges the following information: 
 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The customer’s ID (the “Owner ID” column of the 
 rowSet returned by the method).</li>
            <li>The customer’s first and last name (the “First 
 Name” and “Last Name” columns of the rowSet returned by the method).</li>
            <li>The support incident ID (the “ID” column of the 
 rowSet returned by the method).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">A method call based on the incident retrieveListQuickSearch 
 method is demonstrated in the overview section for Method Calls. That method call example 
 retrieves data similar to that required of the example template for Email(2).</p>
