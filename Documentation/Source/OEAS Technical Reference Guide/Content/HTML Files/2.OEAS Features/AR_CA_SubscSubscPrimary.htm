        <h1>Subscribe primary object and cascade its subscription relationships 
 </h1>
        <p>The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Subscribe primary object and cascade its subscription 
 relationships</span> rule can be set at the relationship level and/or 
 the role level. </p>
        <p>Setting this rule to true for a subscription relationship ensures that 
 when an end-user subscribes to the secondary object in the relationship, 
 an automatic (cascaded) subscription to the relationship’s primary object 
 is created for that subscriber. </p>
        <p>In addition, the cascade process also checks for rules on any relationships 
 of the primary object and, if found, will subscribe that object’s related 
 objects to the subscriber as well, both primary and secondary, where directed 
 by those rules. The cascade process continues to auto-subscribe records 
 to the subscriber in this manner until there is no further relationship 
 to process. For example, when the top-level object is reached, when a 
 duplicate (already subscribed) object is reached, or when an object is 
 reached that does not have a subscription relationship with cascade rules. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The original subscription to the secondary object can be 
 a result of the end-user explicitly subscribing to the object herself, 
 an advanced subscriber subscribing the object to the user, or another 
 cascade process. In any case, once the subscription is created, the cascade 
 process will proceed as described when this rule is set to true.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Example: </p>
        <p>Suppose you have the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A subscribable company object.</li>
            <li>A subscribable individual object with a subscription 
 relationship between the company and individual objects based on the OEDB 
 <em class="Emphasis">company ID of the individual</em> relationship, for 
 which the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Subscribe primary object and cascade its 
 subscription relationships </span>rule is set to true.</li>
            <li>A subscribable incident object with a subscription 
 relationship between the individual and incident objects based on the 
 OEDB <em class="Emphasis">individual primary contact of an incident</em> 
 relationship, for which the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Subscribe primary object 
 and cascade its subscription relationships </span>rule is set to true.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this case, by subscribing to the incident, an end-user is automatically 
 subscribed to the incident’s primary contact (individual) and the company 
 to which that individual belongs. </p>
