        <h2>Surveys </h2>
        <p>Surveys are information-gathering tools that 
 can help you collect targeted information about your customers and therefore 
 more effectively serve them. Among the numerous benefits of well-administered 
 surveys are more accurately targeted campaigns and increased customer 
 input on future product development. </p>
        <p>For example, with surveys, customers can provide information 
 about themselves by answering questions about: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Their level of expertise with your company’s products</li>
            <li>The products they use, and how they use them</li>
            <li>Which markets they're targeting</li>
            <li>Their future interests in products</li>
            <li>Personal information</li>
            <li>Company size</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A survey that you create with the Survey feature is a set of questions 
 that might have a hierarchical structure, and the responses associated 
 with those questions. When respondents take the survey, their answers 
 are associated with both the questions and the respondents.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You create surveys and their questions with the 
 Survey Administration tool in Onyx Enterprise Studio (OES). </li>
            <li>Surveys and their data, questions, and possible 
 responses reside in the Onyx Enterprise Database (OEDB). </li>
            <li>Your employees or customers can enter answers 
 with Onyx Employee Portal (OEP) or Onyx Customer Portal (OCP).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">You can also create a custom application for entering respondents’ 
 answers to a survey.</p>
