        <h2>Contacts </h2>
        <p>The Contacts feature provides users a means of establishing and maintaining 
 relationships between records in the database (customer, incident, task, 
 work ticket, and customer product) and internal users and customers (both individuals 
 and companies). Contacts are categorized by groups, categories, and types.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">For information on primary contacts, see <a href="ar_ca_customerwhatiscustomer.htm">Customers</a>.
</p>
        <h4>Contact groups </h4>
        <p>Contacts are organized by contact groups: customer and internal. Each contact group can be associated with many 
 contact types.</p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Customer -</b> Customer contacts define relationships 
 between companies and individuals with whom you do business. An example 
 of a customer contact is a purchasing manager at an external company. 
 An end user can set this person as a customer contact on that company’s 
 main record so that all internal employees are aware of this information. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Although customer contacts are usually used to establish 
 contact relationships at the customer's organization, users can assign 
 any individual or company (in the system as a customer record) as the 
 external contact for an incident, task, or customer product, as well as 
 any other customer record. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Internal -</b> Internal contacts define a relationship between a record  and a user in the database. 
 Users can add one or more internal contacts to each record. Internal 
 contacts are generally individuals within your organization appointed 
 to manage the customer. An example of an internal contact relationship 
 is specifying a sales representatives as the designated sales representative 
 for a customer. Each Onyx user added using&#160;Security Administration is an internal contact. 
 </p>
        <h4>Contact categories </h4>
        <p>Contacts are further organized by category, with each 
 category existing in both contact groups (customer and internal). You can assign multiple internal and external contacts to each category. Each contact category can be associated with many 
 contact types. The 
 contact categories for the Contacts feature are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Company -</b> This 
 contact category supports the internal and customer contacts on the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Company</span> form of the OEP client.</li>
            <li><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Incident -</b> This 
 contact category supports the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Contacts</span> tab 
 for internal and customer contacts on the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Incident</span> 
 form of the OEP client.</li>
            <li><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Individual -</b> 
 This contact category supports the internal and customer contacts on the 
 <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Individual</span> form of the OEP client.</li>
            <li><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Product -</b> This 
 contact category supports the internal and customer contacts for customer 
 product records, as available on the OEP client on the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Products</span> 
 node of the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Companies</span> or <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Individuals 
 PowerPage</span>.</li>
            <li><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">WorkTicket -</b> 
 This contact category supports the internal and customer contacts for 
 work ticket records.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Contact types </h4>
        <p>Contact types classify contacts within the contact group/category combinations. 
 You define contact types using Contact Type Administration, creating logical 
 groupings of contacts for a contact group/category combination. Each contact type must have a contact group and 
 a contact category.</p>
        <p>Contact types created in the customer group of a contact category are 
 used to model your customer’s organization. Contact types created in the 
 internal group of a contact category are used to model your organization. </p>
