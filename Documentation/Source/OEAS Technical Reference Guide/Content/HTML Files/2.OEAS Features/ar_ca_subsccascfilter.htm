        <h1>Cascade only the secondary objects that meet this filter expression 
 </h1>
        <p>The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Cascade only the secondary objects that meet 
 this filter expression </span>rule can be used to limit cascaded subscriptions 
 to a defined subset of an object type (for instance a particular incident 
 or task category). It can be set at the relationship level and/or the 
 role level, but can only be set if you have enabled the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Subscribe 
 secondary object and cascade its subscription relationships </span>rule. 
 </p>
        <p>Providing a filter expression for a subscription relationship ensures 
 that when an end-user subscribes to the primary object in the relationship, 
 an automatic (cascaded) subscription to the relationship’s secondary objects 
 is created for that subscriber, but only to those secondary objects that 
 meet a specified filter expression criteria. </p>
        <p>In addition, the cascade process also checks for rules on any relationships 
 of the secondary objects and, if found, will subscribe those objects’ 
 related objects as well, both primary and secondary, where directed by 
 those rules. The cascade process continues to auto-subscribe records to 
 the subscriber in this manner until there is no further relationship to 
 process. For example, when the top-level object is reached, when a duplicate 
 (already subscribed) object is reached, or when an object is reached that 
 does not have a subscription relationship with cascade rules. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The original subscription to the primary object can be a 
 result of the end- user explicitly subscribing to the object herself, 
 an advanced subscriber subscribing the object to the user, or another 
 cascade process. In any case, once the subscription is created, the cascade 
 process will proceed as described when this rule is set to true.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Example: </p>
        <p>Suppose you have the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A subscribable company object.</li>
            <li>A subscribable incident object with a subscription 
 relationship between the company and incident objects based on the OEDB 
 <em class="Emphasis">company owner of an incident</em> relationship, for 
 which the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Cascade only the secondary objects that 
 meet this filter expression </span>rule is set to “iIncidentCategory=3” 
 so that cascaded subscriptions are created only for sales incidents.</li>
            <li>A subscribable task object with a subscription 
 relationship between the incident and task objects based on the OEDB <em class="Emphasis">incident owner of a task</em> relationship, for which the 
 <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Subscribe secondary object and cascade its subscription 
 relationships </span>rule is set to true.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this case, when an end-user subscribes to a company, cascaded subscriptions 
 are created for the end-user to all of the “sales” type incidents owned 
 by that company, as well as to all of the tasks owned by those sales incidents.
