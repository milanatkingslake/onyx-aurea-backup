        <h3>Troubleshooting </h3>
        <p>Following are some issues that might arise as you design, create, and 
 make scripts available for use. </p>
        <h4>Script steps and the Active property </h4>
        <p>If in an existing script session you encounter an error message that 
 a step is inaccessible, the step might have been made inactive. </p>
        <p>You cannot set the Active property for a script step in the Script Designer, 
 because making a step inactive breaks any existing script sessions, causing 
 the previously mentioned error message. However, it is possible for the 
 step’s Active property to be set to “inactive” by other means than the 
 Script Designer. If you see the message that a step is inaccessible, investigate 
 whether the Active property is set to inactive. For more information on 
 the Active property, see the <span style="font-style: italic;">OEAS Developer’s 
 Reference</span>. </p>
