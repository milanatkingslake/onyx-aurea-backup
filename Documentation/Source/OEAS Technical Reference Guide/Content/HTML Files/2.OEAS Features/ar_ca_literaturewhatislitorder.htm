        <h3>What are literature orders? </h3>
        <p>Literature orders are transactional records, created by employees, that 
 associate literature products with customers. You can use them to track 
 what literature products a customer has been sent or has requested, and 
 you can use them to facilitate delivery of literature products to a customer 
 when you implement a literature fulfillment system, such as with Onyx 
 Processing Server. </p>
        <p>Employees can create any number of literature orders for a customer, 
 associating any number and combination of literature products with these 
 orders. They can select the shipping method, payment terms, and literature 
 type. They can also associate the literature order with a tracking code, 
 and indicate if the order should be completed immediately or in a regularly 
 scheduled batch job. </p>
        <p>Using the Onyx handlers or a custom application of your own, you can 
 configure your application to process literature orders immediately or 
 in a batch. If your customer requires the order as soon as possible, the 
 employee can mark it for immediate real-time processing. Otherwise, the 
 order is processed in a batch with other orders, at a time that you configured 
 the application to process the batch. </p>
        <p>The main elements of the Literature Orders feature 
 include the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Literature order header</li>
            <li>Literature order details</li>
            <li>Literature printer</li>
            <li>Literature products</li>
            <li>Literature type</li>
            <li>Ship method</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Literature order header -</b> The literature 
 order header is the part of the literature order that contains information 
 about the entire order, regardless of the number of literature products 
 included in the order. This information includes such details as the customer 
 name, billing and shipping addresses, order priority, order date, ship 
 method, and payment terms. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Literature order details -</b> Each 
 order detail for a literature order contains the reference to a specific 
 literature product and information about that literature product including 
 price, quantity, and shipping status. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Literature printer -</b> The literature 
 printer is a networked printer that you have associated with those literature 
 products that can be printed prior to delivery. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Literature product -</b> A literature 
 product is any type of electronic or physical item that can be delivered 
 as mail, and/or email, and that you have configured as a literature 
 product using Product Administration. Literature products can include 
 marketing collateral, such as letters, brochures, pamphlets, posters, 
 press materials, white papers, direct mail items, and photographs; saleable 
 items, such as mailing lists, software programs, or printed documentation; 
 or informational packets or promotional pamphlets that you send to customers 
 to promote and supplement your standard products. Compared to a standard 
 product, literature products can have additional attributes, such as a 
 file path location and a printer path location. </p>
        <p>Additionally, you can create literature items that end users can attach 
 to their email messages through the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Add Literature 
 Attachments</span> page. See configuring <a href="../3.Configuring OEAS Features/ar_emailconfigoptions.htm">Email</a>  in the <span style="font-style: italic;">OEAS 
 Administrator’s Reference</span> for complete instructions. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Fulfillment 
 types -</b> The fulfillment types are attributes that you associate 
 with a literature product when you create the product in Product Administration. 
 These attributes support the Onyx Processing Server (OPS) and impact how 
 the literature product is processed. You can associate more than one fulfillment 
 type with a literature product, but employees can select only one of those 
 fulfillment types when they add that literature product to a literature 
 order. For additional information regarding the available fulfillment 
 types and the purpose of each, see What is the Onyx Processing Server? in the <span style="font-style: italic;">OEAS 
 Administrator’s Reference</span>. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"> In the OEP Web client, fulfillment types are listed as literature 
 types.</p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Ship method -</b> Ship method is a literature 
 order attribute that employees select when the literature order needs 
 to be mailed to the recipient. The different means for shipping can include 
 First Class, Second Class, UPS, Federal Express, and so on. </p>
