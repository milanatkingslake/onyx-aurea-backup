        <h2>Alerts </h2>
        <p>The Alert feature is the set of Onyx Enterprise Application Server (OEAS) 
 and Onyx Employee Portal (OEP) functionality that enables an OEP user 
 to associate a text message with a company, individual, or incident record. 
 The message appears in a pop-up window whenever an OEP user opens the 
 record. </p>
        <p>Suppose, for example, that technical support created a support incident 
 concerning a particular customer (company or individual). In OEP, the 
 technical support staff could create an alert to notify other OEP users 
 of pending resolution of the incident, associating the alert with the 
 customer record. Whoever brings up the customer in OEP sees the alert, 
 which tells them about the incident. When the incident is resolved, the 
 technical-support staff deletes the alert. Or if the incident becomes 
 date-driven—if, for instance, the incident will be resolved when the customer 
 receives a patch or a hotfix—an OEP user can specify a date for the alert 
 to expire. </p>
