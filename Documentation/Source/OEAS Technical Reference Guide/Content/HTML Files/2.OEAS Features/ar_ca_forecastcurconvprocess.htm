        <h4>Currency conversion processing </h4>
        <p>When an end user creates line items for a forecast or quote (that is, 
 associates a product to the forecast or quote), the forecast or quote 
 and its associated line items are saved with a primary currency and, optionally, 
 with a secondary currency. These primary and secondary currencies are 
 determined by the forecast or quote. If the products added as line items 
 have a base monetary value of a different currency than that selected 
 for the primary currency of the forecast or quote, the base product price 
 is converted to the primary currency. If the user creates the forecast 
 or quote with two currencies, OEAS converts the currency between the monetary 
 values of the primary currency line items and the secondary currency to 
 determine the monetary values of the secondary currency line items. </p>
        <p>OEAS converts one currency value to another currency by evaluating the 
 two currencies involved. The currencyConversion object properties that 
 are evaluated are currencyCodeFrom (the initial currency) and currencyCodeTo 
 (the new currency). The conversion rate for this combination, the rate 
 property, is the value used to calculate the conversion between the two 
 currencies. </p>
