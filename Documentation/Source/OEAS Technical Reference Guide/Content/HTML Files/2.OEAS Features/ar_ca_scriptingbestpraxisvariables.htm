        <h4>Variables: considerations when using </h4>
        <p>The basic paradigm for variable scope is that scalar 
 variables should be global, and list variables should be step-local. However, 
 you can vary from this paradigm if you keep the following in mind: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If a variable is used only in one step, the variable 
 can be step-local.</li>
            <li>If the value of a step-local scalar variable is 
 set by a pre method call, the value remains when the user returns to the 
 step. If the value is set by the userâ€™s response to a prompt, the value 
 of the variable is lost as soon as the user moves to another step. However, 
 if the user returns to the step, the prompt whose response supplied the 
 value to the variable still has the same response.</li>
            <li>List variables can be global, if you want to reuse 
 their values. However, maintaining a global variable that contains a large 
 list can impact performance. </li>
        </ul>
