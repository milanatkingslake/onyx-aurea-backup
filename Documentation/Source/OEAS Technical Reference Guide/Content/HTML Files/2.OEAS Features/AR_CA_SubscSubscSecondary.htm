        <h1>Subscribe secondary object and cascade its subscription relationships 
 </h1>
        <p>The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Subscribe secondary object and cascade its 
 subscription relationships</span> rule can be set at the relationship 
 level and/or the role level. </p>
        <p>Setting this rule to true for a subscription relationship ensures that 
 when an end-user subscribes to the primary object in the relationship, 
 an automatic (cascaded) subscription to the relationship’s secondary objects 
 is created for that subscriber. </p>
        <p>In addition, the cascade process also checks for rules on any relationships 
 of the secondary objects and, if found, will subscribe those object’s 
 related objects to the subscriber as well, both primary and secondary, 
 where directed by those rules. The cascade process continues to auto-subscribe 
 records to the subscriber in this manner until there is no further relationship 
 to process. For example, when the top-level object is reached, when a 
 duplicate (already subscribed) object is reached, or when an object is 
 reached that does not have a subscription relationship with cascade rules. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The original subscription to the primary object can be a 
 result of the end- user explicitly subscribing to the object herself, 
 an advanced subscriber subscribing the object to the user, or another 
 cascade process. In any case, once the subscription is created, the cascade 
 process will proceed as described when this rule is set to true.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Example: </p>
        <p>Suppose you have the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A subscribable company object.</li>
            <li>A subscribable incident object with a subscription 
 relationship between the company and incident objects based on the OEDB 
 <em class="Emphasis">company owner of an incident</em> relationship, for 
 which the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Subscribe secondary object and cascade 
 its subscription relationships </span>rule is set to true.</li>
            <li>A subscribable task object with a subscription 
 relationship between the incident and task objects based on the OEDB <em class="Emphasis">incident owner of a task</em> relationship, for which the 
 <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Subscribe secondary object and cascade its subscription 
 relationships </span>rule is set to true.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this case, when an end-user subscribes to a company, automatic (cascaded) 
 subscriptions are created for the end-user to all of the incidents owned 
 by that company, as well as to all of the tasks owned by those incidents.
