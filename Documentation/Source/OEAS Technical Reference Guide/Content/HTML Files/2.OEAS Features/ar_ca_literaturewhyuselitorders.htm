        <h3>Why use literature orders? </h3>
        <p>Two possible uses for literature orders are to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improve customer relations by optimizing the process 
 of fulfilling customer requests for product information</li>
            <li>Automate distribution of an executable file</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Example:<span style="x-text-overline: off;x-text-line-through: off;text-decoration: none none none;"> 
 Fulfilling customer requests for product information</span></p>
        <p>Suppose that a customer calls your organization and requests an additional 
 user manual for one of your products. The customer service representative 
 can open the customer record, verify the product that is registered to 
 the customer, and do the following: </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>create the literature order with a literature 
 order detail line for the literature product that represents the user 
 manual </li>
            <li>create a second literature order detail line for 
 the order—a literature product that represents a standard form letter 
 thanking the customer for their business</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Because you configured the user manual literature product in Product 
 Administration to be either printed and mailed or emailed, the customer 
 service representative must select the appropriate literature type, based 
 on the customer’s preference. In this case the customer would like the 
 manual to be printed and mailed, and the customer service representative 
 selects the literature type that specifies this. You configured the standard 
 form letter literature product to be sent only by email, and so the customer 
 service representative selects that literature type for this literature 
 product. </p>
        <p>The result is that the customer will soon receive an email thanking 
 him for his business, and the user manual will be printed at your organization 
 and mailed to the customer. There is no need for handwritten notes, and 
 no need to forward the customer to another employee to address the literature 
 request. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Example: Automating distribution of an executable file 
 </p>
        <p>Suppose that your organization creates and sells software 
 programs and that you have developed an upgrade utility for one of the 
 programs. Using literature orders, two possible ways you can make this 
 utility available to customers who request it are to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Send the upgrade utility to customers as an email 
 attachment. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">Using Product Administration, you can create a literature product 
 representing the upgrade utility, specifying the path to where the executable 
 file is located on the server and indicating the appropriate literature 
 type and transport so that the executable file can be sent to customers 
 as an email attachment. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mail the upgrade utility CD and printed user manual 
 to customers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">Using Product Administration, you can create a literature product 
 representing the upgrade utility (including the documentation). You can 
 configure this literature product, setting the appropriate literature 
 type and transport, to print to an order list in your organization’s mailroom 
 so that a mailroom employee can package the CD and user manual together 
 and mail the package to customers who have ordered the upgrade utility.
