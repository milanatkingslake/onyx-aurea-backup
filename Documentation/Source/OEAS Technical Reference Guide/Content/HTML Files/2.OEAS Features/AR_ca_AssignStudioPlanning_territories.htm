        <h3>Planning territories</h3>
        <p>A territory assignment structure typically consists of one or more territories, 
 conditions, assignment sets, and users. This data is flexible and can 
 be organized to support various business models. Your structure should 
 match your organization's business model (rules) for assigning leads to 
 customers and incidents.</p>
        <p>When you plan your territory structure, consider the 
 following:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li><a href="ar_ca_assignstudiocreatingcontacts.htm">Internal 
 contacts</a> for customers and incidents.</li>
            <li><a href="AR_ca_AssignStudioincidentterritories.htm">Incident 
 territories</a> for the assignment of incidents.</li>
            <li>Nested territories 
 and prioritized processing 
 for organizational flexibility.</li>
            <li>Territories and assignment 
 sets based on a business model developed from your business rules. For 
 more information on these concepts, see the sample <a href="AR_ca_AssignStudioExample__Business_model.htm">business 
 model</a>.</li>
