        <h3>Example use of the Email feature </h3>
        <p>The following example demonstrates how you might use the Email feature 
 to support your company’s customer relationships. </p>
        <h4>Example: Sales group at Chocolate Inc.</h4>
        <p>Suppose a sales group for Chocolate Inc., an online chocolate retailer, 
 uses the Email feature to handle their customer correspondence. </p>
        <p>Chocolate Inc. sales representatives’ tasks include 
 taking phone calls from customers and promoting products on the Chocolate 
 Inc. Web site using a corporate alias. The sales representatives’ uses 
 of OEP and Onyx Email for Outlook could include the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using Task Manager to search for emails marked 
 for follow-up and their assigned sales incidents.</li>
            <li>Using Onyx Email for Outlook to record and track 
 emails in OEAS.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using the Email feature, Chocolate Inc. can quickly respond to customer 
 requests, track email threads, and close deals. </p>
        <p>Following are the steps involved:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="ar_ca_emailexamplestep1.htm">Step 1: Interested customer sends an email to the corporate alias</a>
            </li>

            </li>
            <li><a href="ar_ca_emailexamplestep5.htm">Step 5: Customer replies to the sales representative</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="ar_ca_emailexamplestep6.htm">Step 6: Sales representative closes the deal</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
