        <h4>Step 6: Sales representative closes the deal </h4>
        <p>The sales representative performs the following tasks: 
 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Discusses the purchase with the individual over 
 the phone. The discussion is notated on the sales incident.</li>
            <li>Completes the purchase and closes the sales incident.</li>
            <li>Responds to the individual’s email by writing 
 a “thank you” reply message from within OEP.</li>
            <li>Before sending the reply email, adds several literature 
 item attachments requested by the individual.</li>
            <li>Sends the “thank you” email to the individual.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In OEAS: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Because the “thank you” email is a reply to the 
 previous email sent by the individual, all non-contact associations to 
 the individual, company, and incident records that were included in the 
 previous email are also created for the “thank you” email.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the end-user interface: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The email appears in the individual, company, 
 and sales incident history pages and in the email thread view.</li>
        </ul>
