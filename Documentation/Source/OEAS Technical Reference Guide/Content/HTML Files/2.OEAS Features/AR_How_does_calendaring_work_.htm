        <h3>How Does Calendaring Work?</h3>
        <p>From Microsoft Outlook, you open an appointment form and, from the <b>Onyx</b> menu option, select <b>Appointment Associations</b>. A window opens displaying all OEP company, individual, and incident records that are currently associated with this appointment.</p>
        <p>If the appointment s new (not yet sent out), the Onyx add-in attempts to translate the selected attendees, resources, and organizer to OEP companies and individuals. You can also search for additional company, individual, or incident records from within the <b>Appointment Associations</b> window, and save them as associations by clicking <b>Save</b>.</p>
        <p>When you send out an Outlook Appointment for the first time, the appointment record and all its associations are automatically saved in OEP via the execution of an OEAS Web Service call.</p>
        <p>When you update an appointment, associations are not updated, you must save the changes directly from the associations form.</p>
        <p>The following graphic is a high-level architecture of the calendaring components.</p>
