        <h3>Elements of security </h3>
        <p>Security begins with users. In addition to users, the primary components 
 of security are roles and resources. The following sections discuss each 
 of these components.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#Users">Users</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="#Roles">Roles</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="#Resource">Resources</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a name="Users"></a>Users</h4>
        <p>Each request to OEAS is submitted in the context of an Onyx user. </p>
        <p>An Onyx user is network-independent, which means that you can log on 
 as a given Onyx user from anywhere on the network, either with or without 
 a Windowsdomain account. Independence 
 from the network allows flexibility in accessing OEAS. For example, users 
 can access OEAS from outside the network through the Web while maintaining 
 the same access privileges as when accessing from inside the corporate 
 network. </p>
        <p>Individuals are logged in as Onyx user accounts either 
 directly or indirectly, depending on which kind of authentication they 
 log in with: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Integrated Windows authentication</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">The user must have a Windows domain account. Once authenticated, 
 the domain account is mapped to an Onyx user account. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Onyx authentication</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">The user logs in directly using an Onyx user account. </p>
        <h4><a name="Roles"></a>Roles</h4>
        <p>Roles are collections of users formed in Security Administration for 
 the purpose of granting (or explicitly denying) access permissions to 
 multiple users at once. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">You cannot add groups to roles; you can only add individual 
 users to&#160;roles.</p>
        <h4><a name="Resource"></a>Resources</h4>
        <p>Resources represent the entities to which you can administer access 
 permissions. These entities can include the OEAS object methods, user 
 interfaces, or any other item that you create as a resource. </p>
        <p>You control access to these entities by granting and denying access 
 permissions for the resources that represent them in Security Administration. 
 With <a href="../4.Using ONYX Enterprise Studio/OES_SecurityHelpStart.html">Security Administration</a>, 
 you can specify user permissions very precisely, without having to program 
 customizations. </p>
