        <h4>Filters </h4>
        <p>There are two ways to apply filters to method calls: 
 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Supply a default value for an input method call 
 detail.</li>
            <li>Include a filter in the element path for an output 
 method call detail.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Generally, you can expect better performance when the method call filters 
 on the input detail, because the OEAS server performs the filtering. However, 
 you must make sure that the underlying OEAS method supports filtering 
 on the input (for example, the element you want to filter on might not 
 be a valid input parameter for the method). If the OEAS method does not 
 support filtering on the input detail, the method call must filter on 
 the output detail in the element path. Refer to the merge template retrieveCollection 
 example (see <i>retrieveCollection</i>) 
 for an example of filtering on the output detail. The contactTypeId is 
 not a valid input parameter for the method, but you can filter on contactTypeId 
 in the element path for the contactUserName output method call detail. 
 </p>
        <p>The recommended approach is to filter on the input for retrieveList 
 method calls and on the output for retrieveCollection method calls.</p>
        <p class="Important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">When you design a retrieveCollection method call to 
 retrieve more than one element from a specific object of the collection, 
 each element returned must include the filter criteria in its element 
 path. Refer to the scripting retrieve example (see <i>retrieve</i>) 
 for an example of filtering on the address element outputs so that only 
 the address lines for the primary address are returned.</p>
