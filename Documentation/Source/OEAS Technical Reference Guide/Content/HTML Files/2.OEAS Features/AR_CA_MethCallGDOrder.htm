        <h4>Sequence order of method call details </h4>
        <p>When you create method call details for a method call in Method Call 
 Designer, you can create them in any order. However, correct sequence 
 order of the method call details is vital for a successful method call. 
 The order in which the method call details exist in Method Call Designer 
 is the order in which the elements they represent are appended to the 
 XML that is created and passed to the OEAS method. When the order of the 
 elements in the XML passed to the OEAS method does not match the order 
 of the elements expected by the OEAS method, the method call fails. </p>
        <p>You can easily adjust an incorrect sequence order using the ordering 
 feature within the Method Call Designer. </p>
