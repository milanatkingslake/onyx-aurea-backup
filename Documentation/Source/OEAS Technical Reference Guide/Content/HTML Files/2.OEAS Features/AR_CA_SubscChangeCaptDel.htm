        <h5>Delete </h5>
        <p>In the event that an object is physically deleted from the Onyx Enterprise 
 Database (OEDB), delete change-capture triggers ensure that these physical 
 deletes are cascaded appropriately by setting the physically deleted object’s 
 sync_action value to 7. This ensures that the deleted object and it's 
 secondary objects are subsequently marked as deleted. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">As noted in <a href="AR_CA_SubscChangeCaptUpda.htm">Update</a>, 
 most transactional objects deleted through OEP and OEP-Offline are logically 
 deleted in the database rather than physically deleted, and are caught 
 by the update change-capture trigger.</p>
