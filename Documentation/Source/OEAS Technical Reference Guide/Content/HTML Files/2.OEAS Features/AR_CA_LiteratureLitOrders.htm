        <h2>Literature Orders </h2>
        <p>The Literature Orders feature enables employees to 
 send literature products by mail or email to customers. 
 Using the Literature Orders feature, employees can create literature orders 
 that: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>print an order list to your organization’s mailroom 
 so that an employee can package and mail a printed documentation set to 
 a customer who has requested it</li>
            <li>email to a customer an upgrade utility (an executable 
 file) that the customer purchased on your organization’s Web site</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Employees can create a separate literature order for each 
 of these examples or, if a single customer is requesting these items, 
 they can create a single literature order that includes all three requests. </p>
        <p>Using the Onyx handlers or a custom application of your own, you can 
 configure your application to process literature orders immediately or 
 in a batch. If your customer requires the order as soon as possible, the 
 employee can mark it for immediate real-time processing. Otherwise, the 
 order is processed in a batch with other orders, at a time that you configured 
 the application to process the batch.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">You cannot configure fulfillment types because the default values are required by the Onyx Processing Server (OPS).</p>
        <p>When reviewing the object and table relationships, 
 note that each literature order can: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>belong to only one individual or company</li>
            <li>include one or more order details (literature 
 products)</li>
            <li>be assigned only one ship method</li>
            <li>be associated with only one tracking code</li>
            <li>have any number of file attachments</li>
        </ul>
