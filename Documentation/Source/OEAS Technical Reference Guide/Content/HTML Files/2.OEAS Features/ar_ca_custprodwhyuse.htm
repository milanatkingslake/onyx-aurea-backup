        <h4>Why use customer products? </h4>
        <p>A typical use of a customer product record is to track and save details 
 of a customer’s purchase. </p>
        <h4>Example: Ticket holders for an Off-Broadway show </h4>
        <p>Several performances have been cancelled due to plumbing problems in 
 an old Off-Broadway theatre. Ticket holders must be notified about the 
 cancellation and given new performance dates.</p>
        <p>The sales associate for the theatre performs a query to identify all 
 ticket holders for the cancelled performances. The sales associate then 
 locates each ticket holder’s customer product record, which contains details 
 of the purchase including the performance date, ticket price, and other 
 relevant information about the ticket holder. Having the purchase information 
 in one central location enables the sales associate to quickly contact 
 the ticket holder, inform them of changes, and update their record with 
 the new performance date. Optionally, the sales associate can include 
 a literature product such as a form letter to notify the customer of future 
 performances.</p>
