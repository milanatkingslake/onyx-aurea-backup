        <h1>Hidden </h1>
        <p>You can define the method call detail <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Hidden</span> 
 attribute only for an input script method call detail. When you define 
 a method call detail as hidden, it is not visible to the method call user. 
 The purpose of this attribute is to enable the method call to pass values 
 to the underlying OEAS method when the method call user neither needs 
 to know about nor can change the value. </p>
        <p>For example, a method call designer can wrap the customer.retrieveList 
 method in a way that allows the method call user to search only for individuals. 
 The method call user should not be able to change the type of search performed 
 (such as to a company), but in order to make the underlying OEAS method 
 properly search for individuals, a default value of “1” must be passed 
 to the method. </p>
        <p>A hidden method call detail without a default value simply results in 
 an XML element being created. This allows the method call designer to 
 build structure in the underlying input XML even for elements that contain 
 no data (for instance, &lt;onyxTimestamp ignore=“1”/&gt;). </p>
