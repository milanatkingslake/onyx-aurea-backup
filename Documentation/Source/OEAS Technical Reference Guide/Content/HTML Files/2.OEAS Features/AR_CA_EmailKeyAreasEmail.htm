        <h3>Key areas of the Email feature </h3>
        <p>The key areas of the Email feature are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="AR_CA_EmailKeyAreasEmail.htm">Attachments 
 for emails</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="AR_CA_EmailKeyAreasEmail.htm">Contact 
 associations</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="AR_CA_EmailKeyAreasEmail.htm">Non-contact 
 associations</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="AR_CA_EmailKeyAreasEmail.htm">Merged 
 templates</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="AR_CA_EmailKeyAreasEmail.htm">The email 
 monitor subsystem</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="AR_CA_EmailKeyAreasEmail.htm">Administration 
 of the Email feature</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Attachments for emails </h4>
        <p>With the Email feature, users can attach files (word processing documents, 
 spreadsheets, sound files, and snapshots) from their hard drive to email 
 messages. Users can also add attachments to their email messages from 
 existing files and literature items in OEAS. For more information, see 
 <a href="ar_ca_emailfileandlit.htm">Attachments for email messages</a>. 
 </p>
        <h4>Contact associations </h4>
        <p>The email system records the contact associations (links) to internal 
 users, individuals, and/or companies that have sent or received an email. 
 Names or partial email addresses are resolved against internal users and 
 individuals in the user interface to create contact associations. For 
 more information, see the Email business objects in the <i>Business Objects Library</i>. </p>
        <h4>Non-contact associations </h4>
        <p>The email system also records the non-contact associations (links) to 
 individual, company, and incident records that are unrelated to the sender 
 or receiver of the email. Using non-contact associations, you can see 
 a conversation between two users related to a customer on that customer’s 
 history list. For more information, see the Email business objects in 
 the Business Objects Library. 
 </p>
        <h4>Merged templates </h4>
        <p>Merged templates enable users to insert into the body of an email message 
 pre-written text and key pieces of data, such as work-ticket or customer 
 summary information. Merged templates require the use of method calls, 
 which you create in Method Call Designer, an OES design tool. For more 
 information, see <a href="AR_CA_EmailMethodCalls.htm">Merged Templates</a>. 
 </p>
        <h4>The email monitor subsystem </h4>
        <p>The Onyx Processing Server (OPS) email monitor subsystems (EMSs) monitor 
 configured mailboxes on network mail servers at set intervals for inbound 
 mail. EMSs process and save emails into the database.</p>
        <p>You can configure an EMS to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitor a corporate email account, such as a generic 
 sales, service, or support inbox. </li>
            <li>Monitor an email account set up in conjunction 
 with Onyx Email for Outlook inbox. Onyx Email for Outlook is a plug-in 
 for Microsoft Outlook with which end-users can save messages into the 
 database from their personal Outlook inboxes and track new messages sent 
 from their personal account in OEP. For more information, see <i>Onyx 
 Email for Outlook</i>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An EMS can also: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create contact associations based on the email 
 addresses of the sender and recipients.</li>
            <li>Create non-contact associations based on the previous 
 email in the thread.</li>
            <li>Flag new emails for follow-up so they can be reviewed 
 by internal users.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>EMS Limitations:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Unicode and accented characters are not supported for EMS. EMS does not deliver, store, or retrieve mail from mailboxes or folders with that contain Unicode or accented characters. To ensure email message delivery, be sure that folder names use the ASCII character set.</li>
            <li>EMS does not support Transport-Neutral Encapsulation Format (MS-TNEF or TNEF) or rich-text format (RTF) for email messages. When an OEP user opens a message that was sent in one of these formats, any TNEF- or RTF-formatted text in the message body does not appear.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="AR_CA_EmailOPSEMS.htm">Email monitor 
 subsystems</a>.</p>
        <h4>Administration of the Email feature </h4>
        <p>The domain data to support the Email feature company-wide 
 is configured using the administration tools of the OES. Administration 
 opportunities include the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Configuring the EMS in OPS</li>
            <li>Configuring attachments for emails</li>
            <li>Configuring email address book item entries (queues)</li>
            <li>Configuring relative dates to enhance date searches 
 for emails</li>
            <li>Configuring template groups and creating method 
 calls for merged templates</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For detailed information about the configuration options for the Email 
 feature, see the material on configuring <a href="../3.Configuring OEAS Features/ar_emailconfigoptions.htm">Email</a> and on configuring <a href="AR_CA_EmailTempGroup.htm">templates</a>.
