        <h3>Preventing access to secured records </h3>
        <p>OEAS and OEP provide several security measures to prevent end-users 
 from accessing records in OEP-Offline that they do not have permissions 
 to access in OEP. </p>
        <p>These security measures include the following. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>OEP UI resources for subscription are not available 
 to non OEP-Offline users</li>
            <li>OEP UI enforces that if a user cannot access a 
 particular type of record, they cannot access the detail form, so they 
 cannot subscribe it. </li>
            <li>OEAS security prevents the sync service from retrieving 
 objects that are secured by impersonating the subscribing user for retrieves.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Subscriptions to secured records can still occur, as described below. 
 However, in all of these cases, although a subscription to the private 
 record is created for the end-user, OEAS security prevents its retrieval 
 and it is not synchronized to OEP-Offline for the user. Furthermore, when 
 the server synchronization is unable to retrieve the record for this reason, 
 it changes the record’s sync_action to 0, so that it will not continue 
 to attempt to retrieve it during subsequent synchronizations. </p>
        <p>Subscription to a secured record can occur as follows: 
 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The platform follows the defined cascade subscription 
 rules and does not include security measures here to prevent subscription 
 to records that are not accessible. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">For instance, if you have a cascade rule set that automatically 
 subscribes incidents when a company is subscribed to, an end-user could 
 subscribe to a company and have cascaded subscriptions created for all 
 of that company’s incidents, even if one or more of those incidents were 
 marked as private. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>An advanced subscriber can subscribe an end-user 
 to an item to which he/she does not have access.</li>
            <li>An offline user might have already subscribed 
 to a record that is subsequently set as private by another OEP user.</li>
        </ul>
