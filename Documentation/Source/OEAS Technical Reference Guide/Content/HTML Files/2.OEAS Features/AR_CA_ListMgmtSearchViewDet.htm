        <h1>Search view details </h1>
        <p>Search view details support search criteria selection, result sets column 
 definition, and result set column headings. </p>
        <p>Search view details further define the search tables, including the 
 search items for those tables that users can select to create their List 
 Manager searches (the default search tables are listed in <a href="AR_CA_ListMgmtSelectSrchCriteria.htm">Selecting 
 the search criteria</a>). The search tables defined by search view details 
 correspond to the database views referenced by <em class="Emphasis">search 
 tables</em>, and the search items correspond to columns of the referenced 
 views. </p>
        <p>For instance, by default, the search table “Product” is included in 
 search view details, as are the search items for Product. The search table 
 Product corresponds to the search table view zCustomer_Product, and the 
 search items of Product correspond to the columns of the actual view. 
 </p>
        <p>Search view details also support result sets column definition since 
 search view detail items can also be configured as result set groups and 
 columns. Users can select from the result set tables and result set columns 
 to define the result set of a search view. </p>
        <p>In addition, these same search view details define the column headings 
 displayed in the user interface for a result set. </p>
