        <h4>How attachments are stored </h4>
        <p>Files attached to an OEP record are uploaded through the browser and stored on a Windows server file share. The OnyxFileAgent component acts as a gatekeeper on the file server by limiting permissions on the share to the component user account. When a user downloads an attachment, OEP calls the OnyxFileAgent component to obtain the document. For more information on OnyxFileAgent setup, see the OEAS Installation Guide.</p>
        <p>OEP uses the fileLink and fileLocation objects of OEAS to implement 
 the attachment feature. OEAS stores the file locations, and OEP controls 
 the file structure for saving the files.</p>
        <p>To prevent name conflicts when a file is uploaded to the server for 
storage, the file is renamed using a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) 
 with the file extension appended. For example, the file “SaleReport.doc” 
 might become”17286F9F-03AE-4AA0-958D-75FFE94616B2.doc” when saved to the 
 file share. OEP does not display the GUID name to the end user. The original 
 file name is stored in the database and mapped to the GUID name. When 
 a user requests the file, the original name is displayed in the UI. </p>
        <p>On the file share server, files are stored in multiple directories using 
 a directory hierarchy based on the first two digits of the GUID file name. 
 </p>
        <p>Under the root are the directories <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">active</span>, 
 <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">deleted</span>, and <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">download</span>. 
 The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">active</span> and <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">deleted</span> 
 directories each contain sixteen directories—one directory for each hex 
 digit 0 - F, as shown in the following example. (The download directory 
 is a temporary storage folder that is only used when clients download 
 files.) </p>

        </p>
        <p>Under the active and deleted directories, there are two more levels 
 of directories—each level has one directory for each hex digit 0 - F. </p>
        <p class="Image"> <img src="../../Resources/Images/AR_activedirectory1.jpg" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #000000;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #000000;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #000000;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #000000;" /></p>
        <p>Active files are attachments that are linked to a parent object (incident, 
 task, and so on) and are accessible in the OEP user interface. Deleted 
 files are attachments that are no longer linked to a parent object and 
 are not accessible in OEP. A system administrator moves attachment files 
 from the active to the deleted tree using the <i>File Link Maintenance utility</i>. Active files are stored at the second level (lowest level) 
 in the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">active</span> directory. Deleted files are 
 stored at the second level in the deleted directory. Using the first two 
 characters of the GUID, you can locate a stored file. For example, the 
 file F1CB22E6-1EF6... would appear in the directory hierarchy as \\<em class="Emphasis">servername</em>\<em class="Emphasis">OEPFileShare</em>\active\F\1, 
 as shown in the following example: </p>
