        <h3>What is calendaring?</h3>
        <p>Calendaring is a system that enables OEP users to 
 associate their Microsoft Outlook appointments, meetings, and events with 
 customers and incidents. Calendaring consists of the following components:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Calendaring for Outlook Add-in</li>
            <li>Calendar feature</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Calendaring for Outlook Add-in</h4>
        <p>Onyx Calendaring for Outlook is a toolbar add-in for Microsoft Outlook 
 that enables users to create appointments, meetings, and events in Outlook 
 and then share them with OEP 
 by creating an association. An association is a way of connecting or linking 
 an appointment, meeting, or event with OEP records. </p>
        <p>The Onyx database manages the relationships between appointments, customers, 
 and incidents, which enables employees to view, share, and act on the 
 same schedule for a particular customer or incident in OEP.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;font-size: 8pt;">Each OEP user 
 installs the add-in program on his or her machine using the setup program 
 distributed by the administrator (the administrator is responsible for 
 configuring the setup program before distribution to end-users). &#160;For 
 more information, see "Installing Calendaring for Outlook" in 
 the <span style="font-style: italic;">OEAS Installation Guide</span>.</p>
        <h4>Calendar feature</h4>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Microsoft 
 Outlook must be configured and running on the client machine before accessing 
 the Calendar feature in OEP. For requirements and implementation information, 
 see the <span style="font-style: italic;">OEAS Installation Guide</span> 
 and Customer Central (http://customers.onyx.com).</p>
        <p>After the appointment is sent 
 through Outlook, users can view Calendar and appointment entries in OEP 
 from the Header Bar, Home Page, Appointments tab, and the History tab. 
 </p>
        <p>For the Calendar feature, you can configure the following.</p>
        <ul>
