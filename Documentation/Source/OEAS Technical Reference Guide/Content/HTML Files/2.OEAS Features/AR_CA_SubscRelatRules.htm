        <h3>Subscription relationships, rules, and roles </h3>
        <p>Subscription relationships are relationships between subscribable objects 
 that are based on existing OEDB relationships for the objects. They enable 
 you to create rules that define automatic (cascading) subscription behaviors 
 between the primary and secondary objects in a relationship. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"> In an object relationship, the primary object is the object 
 that owns the secondary object.</p>
        <p>When you enable subscription rules for subscription relationships, you 
 enable the following cascading subscription behaviors. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Cascaded subscriptions -</b> A cascaded 
 subscription is the automatic subscription created for an object related 
 to the object to which an OEP end-user has subscribed. For instance, suppose 
 your business rules require that your OEP-Offline end-users have access 
 to an incident’s primary contact. Rather than having an end-user manually 
 subscribe to both the incident and the primary contact, you can create 
 a subscription rule that automatically creates the primary contact subscription 
 for the user when that user subscribes to the incident. </p>
        <p>In addition to the cascaded subscriptions created 
 for the user at the time that he subscribes to an object, automatic subscriptions 
 are subsequently also created to any new or updated objects that are related 
 to the object to which he had previously subscribed. For instance, suppose: 
 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have a subscription rule that ensures that 
 when an end-user subscribes to an incident, he is automatically subscribed 
 to all the tasks of that incident. Subsequently, when a new task is created 
 for that incident, a subscription to that new task is automatically created 
 for the user. </li>
            <li>You have a subscription rule that ensures that 
 when an end-user subscribes to a company, he is automatically subscribed 
 to that company’s primary contact (individual). Subsequently, when the 
 primary contact for that company is changed to another individual, a subscription 
 to the company’s new primary contact is automatically created for the 
 user. The user would, however, need to unsubscribe from the previously 
 subscribed primary contact (individual).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These subscriptions occur automatically because when the object is created 
 or updated, it causes a re-cascade to be run on the primary object in 
 the relationship, which causes the new or updated secondary object to 
 be subscribed. For additional information, see <a href="ar_ca_subscchangecapt.htm">Change-capture 
 triggers</a>. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Unsubscribing can affect subsequent cascaded subscriptions. 
 When an end-user explicitly unsubscribes from an item, they are only re-subscribed 
 to that item if they explicitly re-subscribe to that item or to another 
 item that would cause a cascaded subscription to it. The cascaded re-subscription 
 to the item is prevented in the case where a related item is updated or 
 created new, causing a re-cascade of all related items. Re-subscription 
 to an explicitly unsubscribed item does not occur when the cascaded subscription 
 is the result of a re-cascade process.</p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Cascaded unsubscriptions -</b> Cascaded 
 unsubscriptions are the automatic unsubscriptions that occur for objects 
 related to the one that an end-user has explicitly unsubscribed from. 
 Cascaded unsubscriptions occur only for secondary objects in a relationship, 
 and they occur only when a required relationship exists between the unsubscribed 
 primary object and the secondary object. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Cascaded unsubscriptions are limited in their scope to only 
 the secondary objects of a required relationship. For more information, 
 see <a href="AR_CA_SubscSyncActionInCasc.htm">The role of the sync_action 
 value in the cascade process</a>.</p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Cascaded deletions -</b> Cascaded deletions 
 occur when an object that an end-user is subscribed to is deleted. A cascaded 
 deletion is not an actual deletion of the related object. Instead a flag 
 is set that unsubscribes and removes the object from OEP-Offline and prevents 
 the object from being re-subscribed. Cascaded deletions occur only for 
 secondary objects in a relationship, and they occur only when a required 
 relationship exists between the deleted primary object and the secondary 
 object. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Cascaded deletions are limited in their scope to only the 
 secondary objects of a required relationship. For more information, see 
 <a href="AR_CA_SubscSyncActionInCasc.htm">The role of the sync_action 
 value in the cascade process</a>.</p>
