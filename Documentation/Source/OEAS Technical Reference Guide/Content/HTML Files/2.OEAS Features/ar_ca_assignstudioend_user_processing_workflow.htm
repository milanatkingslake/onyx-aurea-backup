        <h4>End user workflow</h4>
        <p>The following end user workflow describes how conditions 
 are evaluated and processed through OEAS and OPM:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>The OEP user creates a company, individual, or 
 incident record and saves it to the Onyx database.</li>
            <li>At run time, the OPM process retrieves an ordered, 
 filtered list of expressions (grouped by condition) from OEAS.</li>
            <li>The OPM process finds the first condition that 
 is true for the record and stops evaluating the expressions. (A condition 
 is true when all of its expressions are true.)</li>
            <li>OPM associates new and updated records with the 
 territory that owns the condition.</li>
            <li>OPM assigns the incident and creates the correct 
 internal contact records.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Condition processing runs in the background and is not visible to end 
 users. </p>
