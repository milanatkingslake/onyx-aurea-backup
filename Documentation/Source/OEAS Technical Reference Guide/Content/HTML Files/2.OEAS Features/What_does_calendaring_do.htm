        <h3>What Does Calendaring Do?</h3>
        <p>With Onyx Calendaring, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>View appointments</b> - you can access your own Outlook calendar via an embedded Outlook View Control in the Home Page and anchor bar.</li>
            <li><b>Save appointments to the OEDB</b> - you can save Outlook appointment records to the OEDB.</li>
            <li><b>Associate appointments</b> - you can associate appointments with company, individual, and incident records. By default, all attendees — both optional and required — who have a corresponding record in OEP and matching email address become associated with the appointment resources.  You can add or remove existing associations after appointments are saved to the OEDB.</li>
            <li><b>View customer appointments in OEP</b> - you can view the details of Outlook appointments that are associated with company or individual records of interest.</li>
            <li><b>View incident appointments in OEP</b> - you can view the details of Outlook appointments that are associated with incident records of interest.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Calendaring scenario</h4>
        <p>Customer service creates an appointment for a conference call with a customer regarding a billing problem. The representative sends a copy to the manager; invites a representative from Accounting to attend the call; and attaches the incident that documents the history of the billing issue. In OEP, the company, the representative, the accountant, the manager, and the attached incident records are all associated with the appointment.</p>
        <p>With Onyx Calendaring, you can navigate to the Appointment tab on the company's PowerPage, double-click the conference call appointment, and view a read-only summary page of the appointment details, notes, and associations.</p>
