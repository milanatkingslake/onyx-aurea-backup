        <h3>Why use work notes? </h3>
        <p>Among the many uses of work notes, two of the most 
 common are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To facilitate discussion of the issues in a task, 
 incident, or work ticket</li>
            <li>To provide important information to the person 
 responsible for completing or resolving a task, incident, or work ticket</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The design of the Work Notes feature, which lets users add new work 
 notes successively rather than modify existing work notes, adds an inherent 
 chronology to the work notes and preserves the integrity of existing work 
 notes. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Example:<span style="x-text-overline: off;x-text-line-through: off;text-decoration: none none none;"> 
 Supplementary sales information</span></p>
        <p>Suppose a company, GlobalHospice, operates hospices 
 associated with hospitals. GlobalHospice is negotiating a contract with 
 a hospital chain for providing post-operative recovery care. In order 
 to track the progress of the negotiations, GlobalHospice’s lead negotiator 
 has attached work notes to the sales incident for the contract. Suppose 
 now that a GlobalHospice employee, John Taylor, has been assigned to research 
 similar contract negotiations. John attaches another work note to enter 
 issues that his research has raised. Another GlobalHospice employee, Carol 
 Sampson, opens the incident, reviews John’s work note, and adds a work 
 note containing her analysis of the issues that John has raised. When 
 the hospital chain suspends negotiations because of a change in key personnel, 
 GlobalHospice’s lead contract negotiator adds another work note summarizing 
 the state of negotiations at that point. Suppose then that Carol is assigned 
 the lead-negotiator duties. As she reviews the work notes attached to 
 the sales incident, she has before her: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The original lead negotiator’s progress notes.</li>
            <li>John’s research results.</li>
            <li>Her own analysis of the issues raised by John’s 
 research.</li>
            <li>A summary of the state of negotiations when she 
 took over as lead negotiator.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As this example shows, when someone is assigned to pursue a sales opportunity, 
 work notes provide that person with an ongoing context and chronology 
 of events to date regarding the opportunity. </p>
