        <h4>Example: Geographic territory assignment</h4>
        <p>The following diagram demonstrates the relationships and types of conditions, 
 expressions, and assignments for a geographic territory.</p>
        <p class="Image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/AR_assignstudioclassdiagram.jpg" style="border: none;width: 345px;height: 576px;float: none;border-style: none;border-style: none;border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #000000;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #000000;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #000000;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #000000;" width="345" height="576" border="0" />

        <p>In this example, the United States is the parent 
 territory of the Pacific Northwest and Southwest (these are child territories). 
 Washington, Oregon, and Idaho are conditions for the Pacific Northwest, 
 and California is a condition for the Southwest. Assignment sets are associated 
 with these conditions (Sales = Bob, Service = Sue is the first assignment 
 set).</p>
        <p><span>Let's assume a company called MBI is created 
 with a primary address that contains a country code of US and a region 
 code of WA. When MBI is created, Bob is made an internal contact for the 
 Sales team, and Sue is made the internal contact for the Service team. 
 Both teams are associated with MBI by using the ownerName, ownerId, and 
 ownerType properties on the incident. </span>
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>If MBI’s primary address 
 contained "OR" (Oregon) in its regionCode, then its sales incidents 
 would include Bob as the contact and the incident would be assigned to 
 Mac.</li>
            <li>If MBI’s primary address 
 contained "ID" (Idaho) in its regionCode, the rules would cause 
 an internal contact to be created using George. The internal contact would 
 be associated to MBI by the ownerId and ownerType properties. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The final assignment set &#160;(Sales 
 = Bob or Mac or George) illustrates the Round Robin assignment type, which 
 assigns incidents to the next user in a pool of users (in turn). The system 
 keeps track of who was assigned last and determines who should be assigned 
 next. You can also assign incidents to the user with the lightest workload 
 through the Least Busy assignment type.</p>
