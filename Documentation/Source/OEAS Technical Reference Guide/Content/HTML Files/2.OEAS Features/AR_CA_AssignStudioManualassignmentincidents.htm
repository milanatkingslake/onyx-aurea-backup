        <h4>Manual assignment of incidents</h4>
        <p>Unlike the company and individual update process, the incident update 
 process is not configured to run on every incident update. For incidents, 
 the update process only runs when an OEP 
 user manually re-assigns an incident to a particular user called the Auto 
 Assign user. The Auto Assign user is specified through the Assigned To 
 property of an incident. You can create an incident assignment set for 
 the Auto Assign user in Assignment Administration to automatically run 
 associated incidents when the incidents update.</p>
        <p>In the OEDB, 
 the Auto Assign value has the user ID of OnyxTMUser 
 and it is included by default with the OEAS 
 installation. Incidents are automatically sent to OPM 
 for re-evaluation when they are assigned to this user. If none of the 
 conditions evaluates to true, then the incident remains assigned to the 
 original OEP 
 user and the Auto Assign value is ignored. This process prevents a dead 
 queue of incidents for the Auto Assign user. </p>
        <p>You can change the criteria used by the incident update method to call 
 the OPM process 
 for the assignment of incidents. For more information, see <a href="../3.Configuring OEAS Features/ar_assignstudiomanual_assignment_of_incidents.htm">Configuring 
 the assignment of incidents</a>.</p>
