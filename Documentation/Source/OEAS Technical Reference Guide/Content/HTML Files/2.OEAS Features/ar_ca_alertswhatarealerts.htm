        <h3>What are alerts? </h3>
        <p>An alert is a text message associated with a company, individual, or 
 incident record. The company, individual, or incident with which the alert 
 is associated is the owner of the alert. The alert pops up each time a 
 user opens the owner record in the PowerPage or from a search list. </p>
        <p>When working with alerts, consider the following: 
 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A user can save an alert independently of the 
 alert owner. This means that in OEP, the user can create, update, or delete 
 an alert without also saving the owner record. </li>
            <li>Users can set alerts to expire after a certain 
 date, or to last indefinitely. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">OEAS does not delete expired alerts. When the owner of an expired 
 alert is called, the calling application can either delete or ignore the 
 alert. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Only one alert at a time can be associated with 
 a particular customer or incident record.</li>
            <li>If two OEP users simultaneously modify a single 
 record, the changes of the one who saves first are saved. The other one 
 receives a notice that his or her save failed because the record is currently 
 being modified.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information on alerts, see the <span style="font-style: italic;">OEP 
 Help</span>. </p>
