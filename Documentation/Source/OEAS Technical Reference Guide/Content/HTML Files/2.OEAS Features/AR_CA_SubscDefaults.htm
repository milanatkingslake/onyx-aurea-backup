        <h4>Default subscription relationships and rules </h4>
        <p>The following subscription relationships are created with installation 
 of OEAS to support the subscribable objects provided with that installation. 
 Rules that are set to true by default for each relationship are listed. 
 No role-based rules are set to true by default. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Always subscribe the primary 
 object</span> rules that are provided by default are required rules. Changing 
 this rule can adversely affect the display of records in OEP-Offline. 
 It can also cause incomplete unsubscription cascades resulting in unnecessary 
 synchronization of records and orphaned offline records (records that 
 the end-user cannot access). For more details about required relationships, 
 see <a href="AR_CA_SubscDefaultsReq.htm">Required subscription relationships</a>.</p>
