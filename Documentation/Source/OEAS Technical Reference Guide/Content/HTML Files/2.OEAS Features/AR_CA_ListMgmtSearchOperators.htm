        <h1>Search operators </h1>
        <p>Search operators are the SQL operators that users can apply to the items 
 that they select as criteria for their List Manager searches. For instance, 
 a user can create a search to retrieve all companies associated with a 
 product serial number similar to “NB3” by using the LIKE operator to narrow 
 the returned results. </p>
        <p>The default search operators that are installed with 
 OEDB include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>operator symbols, such as:</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">= (equals)</p>
        <p class="Indent1">&lt;&gt; (not equal 
 to)</p>
        <p class="Indent1">&gt; (greater than)</p>
        <p class="Indent1">&lt;= (less than 
 or equal to)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>string operators, such as BETWEEN, LIKE, IN, NOT 
 IN, IS NULL and IS NOT 
 NULL.</li>
        </ul>
