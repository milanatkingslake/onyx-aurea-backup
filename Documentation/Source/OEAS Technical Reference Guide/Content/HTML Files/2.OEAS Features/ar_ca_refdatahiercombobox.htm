        <h1>Hierarchical-combo boxes </h1>
        <p>You can create hierarchical-combo boxes by associating one combo box 
 to another combo box. As the following diagram illustrates, the parentName 
 and parentId properties (in addition to the referenceId and parameterId 
 properties) are essential for creating this relationship. </p>
        <p>In the diagram below, notice that company.type and company.subType have 
 a parent-child relationship, which is established by the parentId property: 
 the child referenceField object, company.subType, has a parentId property 
 that identifies the referenceField named company.type as its parent. The 
 effect of this, on the user interface, is that only after end-users supply 
 a value for company.type can they then choose a value for company.subType, 
 since the values available for company.subType depend on the value selected 
 for company.type. </p>
        <p>Also notice that the referenceLookup objects "Technology" 
 and "Hi-Tech" have a parent-child relationship, which is established 
 by the parentId property: the child referenceLookup object, “Hi-Tech,” 
 has a parentId property that identifies the parameterId property of the 
 referenceLookup object that is its parent. The effect of this, on the 
 user interface, is that only after end-users choose a value of “Technology” 
 for the referenceField object named company.type can they then supply 
 the value of “Hi-Tech” for company.subType. This same logic is applied 
 to the parent referenceLookup object “Insurance” and its child referenceLookup 
 objects “Auto,” “Home,” and “Property.” </p>
