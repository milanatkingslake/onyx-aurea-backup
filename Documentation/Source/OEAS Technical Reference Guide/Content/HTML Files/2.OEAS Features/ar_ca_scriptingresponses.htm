        <h4>Responses </h4>
        <p>In considering responses to prompts, it is important 
 to distinguish between prompt responses and session prompt responses: 
 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A prompt response is a possible or available answer 
 to a prompt.</li>
            <li>A session prompt response is the response made 
 by the end-user in a particular script session.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some prompt control types (“Check box set,” “Drop 
 down list box,” “List box,” and “Radio button set”) provide lists of prompt 
 responses, which can be either fixed or variable. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed prompt responses are those that the script 
 designer defines for a static list.</li>
            <li>Variable prompt responses are those in a list 
 that is populated by the contents of a variable. A method call populates 
 the variable from which the list is derived.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For prompts of control types such as text box or masked edit, the end-user 
 provides the content of the session prompt response. In addition, for 
 fixed responses for check box set and drop down list box prompts, the 
 designer can specify that users can edit one of the prompt responses.
