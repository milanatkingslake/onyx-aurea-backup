        <h3>The National Language data set </h3>
        <p>The National Language tables of the OEDB store all of the message strings, 
 column headings, captions, and labels that appear in the end-user interface. 
 The two primary tables are National Language and NatLangConfig (their 
 schemas are identical). </p>
        <p>The National Language table stores all of the data strings that are 
 provided at install or through upgrades for OEAS. When you customize (add, 
 modify, or delete) strings in the National Language table using the Table 
 Administration tool, the customized strings are stored in the NatLangConfig 
 table. Your customizations only affect the NatLangConfig table and not 
 the National Language table. </p>
        <p>Having two tables eases software upgrades because the message strings 
 in the National Language table are updated with the new software and your 
 customized strings remain untouched in the NatLangConfig table. When a 
 National Language string is retrieved from the OEDB, the string is first 
 searched for in the NatLangConfig table, where the customized data strings 
 are stored. If it does not exist there, the string is obtained from the 
 National Language table. </p>
        <p>Always use the Table Administration tool to customize data strings in 
 the National Language table. This will ensure that your customized strings 
 are not lost during software upgrades. </p>
