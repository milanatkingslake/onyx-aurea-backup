        <h3>Scripting feature </h3>
        <p>The Scripting feature is the collection of OEAS functions with which 
 you can design, create, test, and publish scripts. The tool for designing 
 and creating scripts is the Script Designer, an OES Design Workbench tool. 
 </p>
        <p>The Web page end-user interface for the script that you create in OES 
 is populated entirely by data received from OEAS. This means that you 
 can create custom end-user interfaces (including specifying the custom 
 calling of any method in OEAS) without having to use code to customize 
 the feature. </p>
        <p>Opening the script in the end-user interface starts a new script session. 
 The session is a single set of end-user responses to the script prompts, 
 which the end-user can later reopen and complete or modify. In OEP, you 
 can create and print out a script session summary, which displays the 
 responses for a session. </p>
