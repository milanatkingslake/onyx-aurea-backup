        <h1>ID Path and Description Path </h1>
        <p>You can define the method call detail <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">ID Path</span> 
 and <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Description Path</span> attributes only for 
 a script output method call detail of the list type. List type output 
 method call details support an output having both an ID component and 
 a description (text) component, although neither component is required. 
 The ID component is typically an identifier for the item returned (such 
 as country.countryCode or company.primaryId), whereas the text component 
 usually represents a user-friendly display string for the item returned 
 (such as country.description). </p>
        <p>The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">ID Path</span> and <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Description 
 Path</span> attributes are always relative to the output nodes, which 
 are located when you specify the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Element Path</span> 
 attribute. For a description of the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Element Path</span> 
 attribute, see <a href="AR_CA_MethCallDetAttElPath.htm">Element Path</a>. 
 </p>
        <p>The following additional details are relevant to the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">ID 
 Path</span> and <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Description Path</span> attributes. 
 </p>
        <h3>ID Path </h3>
        <p>The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">ID Path</span> attribute specifies an XPath 
 that locates the outputâ€™s ID component. The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">ID Path</span> 
 is optional. If it is null, the returned output does not contain an ID 
 component. </p>
        <p>The path is always relative to the output nodes, which are located by 
 the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Element Path</span> attribute. The path should 
 lead to a single element that is a descendant of an output node. The path 
 should not include traversal operations that try to access elements above 
 the output node. If the path does not result in a selected node when the 
 method call is executed, the returned output contains an empty ID component. 
 </p>
        <h3>Description Path </h3>
        <p>The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Description Path</span> attribute specifies 
 an XPath that locates the value of the text component. The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Description 
 Path</span> attribute is optional. If it is null, the returned output 
 does not contain a text component. However, it can still contain a text 
 component and/or an ID component. </p>
        <p>The path is always relative to the output nodes, which are located when 
 you specify the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Element Path</span> attribute. The 
 path should lead to a single element that is a descendant of an output 
 node. Like the ID path, the description path should not include traversal 
 operations that try to access elements above the output node. If the path 
 does not result in a selected node when the method call is executed, the 
 returned output contains an empty description component. </p>
