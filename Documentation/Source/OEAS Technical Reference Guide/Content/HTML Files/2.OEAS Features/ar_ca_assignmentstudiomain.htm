        <h2>Assignment Studio</h2>
        <p>Assignment Studio is the collection of Onyx Enterprise Application Server (OEAS), Onyx Enterprise Studio (OES), and Onyx Process Manager (OPM) functionality that provides territory and lead management for Onyx Employee Portal (OEP).</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Documentation on integration between Assignment Studio and BRM is currently not available.</p>
        <p>Assignment Studio is comprised of the following components:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>
                Assignment Administration
</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">The OES Assignment Administration tool is the main feature of Assignment Studio, that enables you to define and implement simple conditions (rules) that are used to do the following:</p>
        <p class="Indent1">With this tool, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="BulletList2">Define a territory assignment structure (hierarchy) 
 that matches your organization's business rules for assigning leads</li>
            <li class="BulletList2">Automatically create internal contacts for company, 
 individual, and incident records</li>
            <li class="BulletList2">Automatically assign incidents (sales opportunities, 
 service requests, and support incidents) to internal users</li>
            <li class="BulletList2">Assign companies and individuals to territories</li>
            <li class="BulletList2">Create contacts to associate with incident conditions</li>
            <li>
                BRM Processes
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">BRM is a system for designing and implementing business processes that 
 work in conjunction with OEAS. Assignment Studio conditions are evaluated 
 through several BRM processes.</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>
                OEAS Business 
 Objects
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">Assignment Studio business objects are responsible for providing information 
 to the BRM processes about internal contacts, incident assignments and 
 their related conditions.</p>
        <p class="ListNote" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Assignment capabilities beyond those provided by Assignment Studio can be accomplished in Onyx Process Manager. Please contact your account manager for additional details.</p>
