        <h3>What is Assignment Studio?</h3>
        <p>The Assignment Studio is a system for designing and 
 implementing territory and lead assignments for OEP. The Assignment Administration 
 tool within Assignment Studio enables you to define and implement simple 
 conditions (rules) that are used to do the following:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>
                Assign companies and individuals to territories
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">You can create conditions to assign a company or individual to a particular 
 territory based on properties of the company or individual object and 
 their associated primary phone and address. </p>
        <p class="Indent1">For example, a regional account sales representative could be assigned 
 to certain customers who live in different geographic regions within the 
 United States. In this case, the customer is associated with a particular 
 territory based on the regionCode property.</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>
                Assign incidents to users
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">You can create conditions to assign an incident to a particular person. 
 Incident assignment is based on the properties of the incident object, 
 and optionally, the properties of the incident's owning customer record.</p>
        <p class="Indent1">For example, a support representative could be assigned responsibility 
 for incoming support incidents, based on the incident product purchased 
 by a customer. When a new support incident is created, the product property 
 of the incident is examined, and the incident is assigned to the support 
 representative based on the incident assignment conditions.</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>
                Create contacts to associate with company 
 or individual conditions
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">You can create contacts to associate with company or individual conditions 
 based on the company or individual's territory assignment.</p>
        <p class="Indent1">For example, a sales representative is assigned responsibility for all 
 companies within a territory. When a new company is saved into the Onyx 
 database, the appropriate sales representative's internal contact type 
 is created based on the company assignment conditions. </p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>
                Create contacts to associate with incident 
 conditions
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">You can create contacts to associate with incident conditions based 
 on properties of the incident object, and optionally, the owning customer's 
 territory assignment. </p>
        <p class="Indent1">For example, a group of service representatives could be assigned responsibility 
 for customers within a territory based on the incident product. When a 
 new service incident is created in the Onyx database, the product property 
 of the incident is examined, and the appropriate service representative 
 is created as an internal contact type for the incident. Selection of 
 internal contacts is based on the incident assignment conditions for the 
 territory.</p>
