        <h2>Incidents </h2>
        <p>Incidents provide the primary means for tracking activities 
 associated with customers (companies and individuals). These activities 
 can include sales opportunities, service requests, support requests, and 
 possibly others. The three default incident categories, organized around 
 these activities, are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sales incidents</li>
            <li>Service incidents</li>
            <li>Support incidents</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">With the Onyx Enterprise Application Server (OEAS), you can 
 configure this feature to include other categories of incident activities 
 that are important to your company. For further information on configuring 
 additional incident categories, see “Configuring OEAS features” in <i>Customizing OEAS</i>.
</p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Sales incidents -</b> Sales incidents 
 are used to categorize and assign sales opportunities. With sales incidents 
 you can keep unlimited work notes, manage quotes and proposals, manage 
 the sales pipeline, forecast sales, schedule appointments, and assign 
 tasks. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Service incidents - </b>Service incidents 
 are used to categorize, assign, and track service-related customer issues. 
 With service incidents you can keep unlimited work notes, track issue 
 resolution, and categorize and assign tasks. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Support incidents -</b> Support incidents 
 are used to categorize, assign, and track support-related customer issues. 
 With support incidents you can keep unlimited work notes, track resolution, 
 and categorize and assign tasks. </p>
        <p>Functionally, the Incidents feature enables end-users to assign tasks 
 and keep work notes as a means of tracking customer issues. Users can 
 relate incidents to incident products, forecasts and quotes, tasks, reminders, 
 and tags. In addition, users can access an incident audit log to view 
 the history of activity for a particular customer interaction. </p>
        <p>The main components of the Incidents feature include 
 the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Incidents</li>
            <li>Work notes</li>
            <li>Audit logs</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Incidents:</b><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span>The incident includes a brief description of the activity or information 
 that it documents, as well as its source, status, priority and severity 
 levels, and resolution codes. It contains information regarding who is 
 currently assigned to the issue, the amount of time expended on the issue, 
 tags associated with the issue, and so on. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Work notes:</b> The work notes of an 
 incident are the text notes entered by the end users that provide information 
 about the incident’s activity or issue. When an end-user creates a work 
 note, OEAS records the date it was created and the ID of the user who 
 created it, enabling other users to quickly identify who provided that 
 particular information on the issue. Users can perform periodic saves 
 on a work note that they are actively writing. However, once a user has 
 saved and closed the work note, it cannot be updated and for any additional 
 comments they want to add, the user must create another work note. Work 
 notes are designed in this manner to ensure the integrity of the historical 
 data. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Audit logs:</b> The audit logs are dated 
 entries that OEAS creates automatically when an incident is created and 
 each time it is updated. It contains key details of the incident, including 
 the current source, status, priority, severity, and assigned-to details. 
 End users can review the audit-log entries for changes in incident details 
 that might not be noted by the end user in the work note, including who 
 changed the priority of a incident and when that change was made. Audit 
 logs cannot be updated or deleted once they have been created. </p>
        <p>Characteristics of an incident:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is owned by a customer (company or individual)</li>
            <li>Must have an incident category</li>
            <li>Can have any number of audited entries, work 
 notes, tasks, tags, file attachments, and associated work tickets</li>
            <li>Can have only one reminder and one alert</li>
            <li>Can be associated with only one incident product </li>
            <li>Can be assigned to only one user</li>
            <li>Can be associated with any number of users as 
 internal contacts and external contacts</li>
            <li>Can have a single primary contact, which is either 
 an individual or a company.</li>
        </ul>
