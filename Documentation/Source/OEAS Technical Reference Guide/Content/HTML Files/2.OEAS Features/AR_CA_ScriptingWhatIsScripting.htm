        <h2>Scripting </h2>
        <p>The Scripting feature is the collection of OEAS functions with which 
 you can design, create, test, and publish scripts. You can design 
 and create scripts using the Script Designer, an OES Design Workbench tool. The Web page end-user interface for the script that you create in OES 
 is populated entirely by data received from OEAS. This means that you 
 can create custom end-user interfaces (including specifying the custom 
 calling of any method in OEAS) without having to use code to customize 
 the feature.
 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A published script appears to users in Onyx Employee Portal (OEP) or 
 another application as a wizard-like series of Web pages. </li>
            <li>Opening the script in the end-user interface starts a new script session. 
 The session is a single set of end-user responses to the script prompts, 
 which the end-user can later reopen and complete or modify. </li>
            <li>Behind the Web 
 pages, the script can do work that would otherwise require the hands-on 
 use of several OES Administration tools, such as analyzing and dissSeminating 
 data within OEAS. </li>
            <li>In OEP, you 
 can create and print out a script session summary, which displays the 
 responses for a session. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Before you can use the Scripting feature, you must contact your Onyx consultant or Onyx Product Support to have the Scripting feature enabled for your installation.</p>
        <h4>What is a script?</h4>
        <p>A script is an end-user interface with which employees 
 can: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Guide their interactions with customers.</li>
            <li>Gather, create, update, or disseminate data throughout 
 Onyx Enterprise Application Server (OEAS).</li>
            <li>Call other OEAS features to perform tasks, including 
 those that otherwise require opening and working in Onyx Enterprise Studio 
 (OES) Administration Workbench tools. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Scripts are used extensively to perform various tasks in contact centers and business process centers.&#160;Examples of tasks that benefit from scripting are telemarketing, technical support, customer service, automated diagnostics, customer follow-up, and automated ordering and mailing processes. </p>
