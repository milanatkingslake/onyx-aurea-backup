        <h4>What is a customer product? </h4>
        <p>When a product is associated with a customer record it becomes a customer 
 product record. A user creates a customer product by selecting a product 
 to associate with a customer record (company or individual), as shown 
 in the following example. </p>
        <p class="Image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/AR_CustomerProducts.jpg" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #000000;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #000000;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #000000;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #000000;" />
        </p>
        <p>A user can also create customer product records using literature products. 
 Literature products are special types of standard products that include 
 functional attributes not included with standard products, such as the 
 ability to be sent directly to a printer. However, in 
 the context of the Customer Products feature, these additional functional 
 attributes of the literature product are ignored. </p>
        <p>The types of products that can be associated with a customer product 
 record include: </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Standard products -</b> The products 
 users can associate with a customer product, literature order, or forecast/quote 
 record. Some examples include health or auto insurance, corporate training, 
 storage space, software upgrades, tickets to a seminar or sporting event. 
 </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Literature products -</b> The special 
 types of standard products that include functional attributes not included 
 with a standard product, such as the ability to be sent directly to a 
 printer. Some examples include marketing collateral, such 
 as letters, brochures, pamphlets, posters, press materials, white papers, 
 direct mail items, and photographs; saleable items, such as mailing lists, 
 software programs, or printed documentation; or informational packets 
 or promotional pamphlets that you send to customers to promote and supplement 
 your standard products. </p>
