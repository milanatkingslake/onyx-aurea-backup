        <h1>Method call details </h1>
        <p>A method call detail provides an input value or an 
 output value that is passed between the method call and the script step: 
 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A method call input is a value that a script step 
 passes to the method named by the method call. </li>
            <li>A method call output is a value that the method 
 passes to the script step.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you define the method call inputs, you also define the binding 
 type: how the value is passed to the step. The binding types all override 
 the default value for the method call input, if one has been defined in 
 Method Call Designer. </p>
        <p>The possible binding types are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Empty</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">Does not bind a value from the script to the method call. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Literal</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">Binds the specified value from the script to the method call. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Null</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">Binds NULL (the NULL=1 attribute) from the script to the method 
 call. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Variable code</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">Binds the value represented by the specified variable code from 
 the script to the method call. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Variable text</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">Binds the value represented by the specified variable text from 
 the script to the method call. </p>
        <p>Method call outputs are passed only as variables. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The status of method calls is not tracked within a script 
 and cannot be used to conditionally call additional method calls on the 
 same step. If one method call on a step fails, none of the following method 
 calls for that step are executed. If one method call fails, another that 
 follows it will not be carried out.</p>
