        <h1>Required subscription relationships </h1>
        <p>In OEAS, certain relationships are required to maintain data integrity 
 within OEAS and to ensure that you can navigate to secondary objects within 
 the user-interface. In most cases, these relationships ensure that an 
 end-user cannot retrieve the primary object in the relationship without 
 also retrieving the secondary objects of that relationship, and that an 
 end-user cannot retrieve the secondary object in the relationship without 
 also retrieving the primary object of that relationship. </p>
        <p>To protect data integrity when subscribing to records for use in OEP-Offline, 
 a default set of required subscription relationships are provided with 
 installation of OEAS. These required relationships provide cascading subscriptions 
 that prevent the primary and secondary objects in a relationship from 
 being subscribed to separately. They also determine which secondary objects 
 should be unsubscribed or deleted when a primary object is unsubscribed 
 or deleted. </p>
        <p>The required subscription relationships that are provided with installation 
 of OEAS are noted in <a href="AR_CA_SubscDefaults.htm">Default subscription 
 relationships and rules</a>. </p>
