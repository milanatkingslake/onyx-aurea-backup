        <h3>Filters </h3>
        <p>A filter is a saved set of search criteria that specify a set of items 
 for Task Manager to display. Filters can apply to a combination of emails, 
 incidents, tasks, and work tickets. </p>
        <p>Some criteria (date or user criteria) are available for searching any 
 objects; other criteria are available only for incidents, for work tickets, 
 or for tasks. In addition, within incidents, the category of incidents 
 to be filtered determines which criteria are available. </p>
        <p>Users can filter items that belong to one or more other users. When 
 a user opens a filter, he or she can change which users are included in 
 the search criteria and then filter items using the changed user criteria, 
 without saving the filter. </p>
        <p>For the Email feature, you can define filters to view and search for 
 incoming email messages sent to the email address queues you configure 
 in Table Administration. See “Using Task Manager” in the <span style="font-style: italic;">OEP 
 Online Help</span> for further information. </p>
        <p>When defining a filter, users can specify either a dynamic time period 
 (such as a certain number of days before the current date) or a time period 
 whose start and end dates are fixed. </p>
        <p>When applying a filter, users can specify a sort column and sort order 
 for the results, and then save them as part of the filter. </p>
        <p>Although Onyx Employee Portal (OEP) by default provides for retrieving 
 filtered lists only of incidents, work tickets, and tasks, it is possible 
 to customize OEAS and the calling program (such as OEP) to enable retrieving 
 filtered lists of any object. </p>
        <p>By default, filters are private: Only the user who creates a filter 
 can select and use it. However, OEAS supports customizations of the calling 
 program to enable creation of filters that other users than the creator 
 of the filter can view. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>For each filter, there is one filter_header and 
 one or more filter_detail records. </li>
            <li>The user who initially saves a filter owns the 
 filter. </li>
            <li>Each user can own multiple filters.</li>
        </ul>
