        <h3>What are Messenger messages, notifications, and reminders? </h3>
        <p>Reminders and messenger messages, although not related to each other, 
 are each notices that OEP users receive; notifications are the periodic 
 searches for reminders and messenger messages. </p>
        <p>When an OEP user sets a recall date for a task or incident and specifies 
 that OEP alert him or her with a dialog box, a reminder is the dialog 
 box that notifies the user of the arrival of the date. The reminder includes 
 full details about the task or incident. </p>
        <p>Messenger messages are the messages that OEP users create and send to 
 each other with the Messenger feature. </p>
        <p>Notifications do not appear in any user interface, although they are 
 called by user interface programs such as Onyx Employee Portal. The periodic 
 checks by these user interface programs for new messages or reminders 
 helps to keep user sessions alive. </p>
