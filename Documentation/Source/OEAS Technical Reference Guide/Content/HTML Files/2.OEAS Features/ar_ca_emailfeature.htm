        <h2>Email </h2>
        <p>The Email feature is the collection of Onyx Enterprise Application Server 
 (OEAS), Onyx Enterprise Studio (OES), and Onyx Processing Server (OPS) 
 features with which you can manage the creation and processing of email 
 messages (emails). This email management system enables end users to read 
 and compose emails that are associated with customer and incident records. 
 All emails sent through the user interface are recorded and tracked in 
 the Onyx Enterprise Database (OEDB). </p>
        <p>The Email feature enables the tracking of email threads, 
 including the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attachments sent with an email.</li>
            <li>Internal users, individuals, and/or companies 
 that have sent or received an email.</li>
            <li>Contact associations (links) to individual, company, 
 and incident records related to an email.</li>
            <li>Non-contact associations (links) to emails associated 
 with individual, company, and incident records unrelated to the sender 
 or receiver of the email.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Emails are automatically assigned to threads when created, but users 
 can manually attach emails to different threads if necessary. An email 
 can be assigned to only one thread at a time. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Email messages can be associated with individuals, 
 companies, internal users, or&#160;incidents.</li>
            <li>Email messages can have many file or literature 
 item attachments.</li>
            <li>A contact is created for each recipient and sender 
 of an email.</li>
            <li>An association can be related to a contact.</li>
        </ul>
