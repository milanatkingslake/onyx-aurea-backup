        <h3>Using Task Manager: an example </h3>
        <p>Suppose that Roland, the lead for an account team at Global Financial 
 Services, has just returned from vacation. To prepare for his team’s status 
 meeting, he opens Task Manager and runs some filters that he created before 
 going on vacation. The purpose of these filters is to view only the tasks 
 that are currently relevant to his team. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">“Status” - </b>Roland 
 uses the Status filter to select the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sales incidents of the Project and Relationship 
 Management groups</li>
            <li>Tasks of both Open and Closed status</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To prepare, Roland runs this Status filter with all his team members 
 selected. To group each team member’s tasks, he sorts the resulting list 
 by his team member’s names. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">“Accomplishments” - 
 </b>To zero in on what his team has completed while he was gone, Roland 
 created the Accomplishments filter by modifying the Status filter to select 
 the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sales incidents with Status of Finished and Closed</li>
            <li>Tasks with Status of Closed and Closed Pending 
 Confirmation </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">“Hot List” - </b>To highlight developments 
 that came up while he was gone, the Hot List filter specifies tasks and 
 incidents created between the beginning and ending dates of his vacation. 
 </p>
        <p>In order to continue using the Hot List filter, Roland changes the filter’s 
 dates from the fixed dates of his vacation to “7 days before today.” </p>
        <p>At the meeting, as Roland gets status from his team members, he performs 
 batch updates to various groups of the sales incidents and tasks on which 
 his team members report progress. </p>
