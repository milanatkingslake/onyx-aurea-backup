        <h1>Role of the Forecast and Quote exchangeRateDate Property </h1>
        <p>The exchangeRateDate property exists in the forecast and quote objects 
 to provide further history about the exchange rate applied to a forecast 
 or quote at the time it was inserted or updated. When you update a previously 
 saved forecast or quote, if the effective date for the exchange rate previously 
 applied to that object has been updated since it was last applied, the 
 current exchange rate is applied to the object and the exchange rate date 
 reflects the update date, not the initial creation date. </p>
