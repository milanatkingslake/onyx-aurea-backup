        <h3>What is a work ticket? </h3>
        <p>A work ticket is a grouping of attributes and notes that show the current 
 and historical aspects of a work activity. It is a means for gathering 
 and preserving information about the activity, enabling you to track the 
 progress of the work. Although similar to tasks in this regard, work tickets 
 can exist without direct association to a customer or incident, or they 
 can be associated to one or more customers and/or one or more incidents. 
 This is useful since it is likely that activities tracked in work tickets 
 are loosely related to one or more customers and/or one or more incidents. 
 </p>
        <p>Functionally, end users create a work ticket to assign an activity to 
 themselves or another user, keep notes about it, and track progress on 
 and completion of the activity. Users can also include contact information 
 with the work ticket, including both internal and customer contacts. The 
 work ticket additionally contains the activity’s history, including who 
 was previously assigned to the activity, and the past status and priority 
 and severity levels assigned to the activity. </p>
        <p>The main elements of the Work Tickets feature include 
 the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Work tickets</li>
            <li>Work notes </li>
            <li>Audit logs</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Work tickets:</b><span style="font-weight: normal;"> <![CDATA[ ]]></span>The work ticket includes a brief description of the activity or 
 information that it documents, as well as its source, status, priority 
 and severity levels, and resolution codes. It can also include product-specific 
 information regarding the product version in which the activity/issue 
 was discovered, the version in which it was completed/fixed, and the version 
 in which it is being released. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Work notes:</b> The work notes of a 
 work ticket are the text notes entered by the end users that provide information 
 about the work ticket’s activity or issue. When an end-user creates a 
 work note, OEAS records the date it was created and the ID of the user 
 who created it, enabling other users to quickly identify who is working 
 on the issue. Users can perform periodic saves on a work note that they 
 are actively writing. However, once a user has saved and closed the work 
 note, it cannot be updated and for any additional comments they want to 
 add, the user must create another work note. Work notes are designed in 
 this manner to ensure the integrity of the historical data. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Audit logs:</b> The audit logs are dated 
 entries that OEAS creates automatically when a work ticket is created 
 and each time it is updated. It contains key details of the work ticket, 
 including the current source, status, priority, severity, and assigned-to 
 details. End users can review the audit-log entries for changes in work 
 ticket details that might not be noted by the end user in the work note, 
 including who changed the priority of a work ticket and when that change 
 was made. </p>
