        <h1>Element Path </h1>
        <p>The method call detail <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Element Path</span> attribute 
 specifies the XML node that the method call detail references. If used 
 for a collection, it specifies a collection of nodes. The element path 
 can be a relative path or an absolute path. Absolute paths begin with 
 a slash (/) character. </p>
        <p>The behaviors and requirements of the element path depend on whether 
 you are creating an input or output method call detail. </p>
        <h3>Input method call details </h3>
        <p>For input method call details, the path specifies an element that can 
 be created in the XML that is sent to the underlying OEAS method (paramXml 
 or customDataXml). The element so specified is called the input element. 
 An input element path cannot refer to an attribute or any other type of 
 node other than an element. </p>
        <p>The path can use only a simple location path (containing element names 
 and slashes). It cannot contain filters, an axis specifier, node tests, 
 or any XPath syntax other than element names and slashes. </p>
        <p>If the path is relative, no leading slash (/) is required since it is 
 relative to the parameters node in paramXml. </p>
        <p>If the path is absolute, it must start with one of 
 the following strings: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>/customData - The input element is created in 
 the customDataXml that is sent to the Transaction Manager. The text after 
 /customData is treated as a relative path specifying an element under 
 the customData node in customDataXml.</li>
            <li>/parameters - The input element is created in 
 the paramXml that is sent to the Transaction Manager. The text after /parameters 
 is treated as a relative path specifying an element under the parameters 
 node in paramXml.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After the initial string, there must be a valid relative XPath (i.e., 
 it is not valid to use /parameters by itself). </p>
        <p>It is necessary to create a method call detail for each element in the 
 element path. For instance, if the elementPath is <b class="Bold">company/phones/phone/primary</b>, 
 you must create a method call detail for the <b class="Bold">company</b> 
 element, the <b class="Bold">phones</b> child element, the <b class="Bold">phone</b> 
 child element, and the final child <b class="Bold">primary </b>element. 
 You must also include any attributes or text when they are needed on an 
 intermediate (parent) node. </p>
        <p>Examples of valid input <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Element 
 Path</span> values: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>company/secondaryId</li>
            <li>/parameters/primaryId</li>
            <li>literatureOrder/literatureOrderLines/literatureOrderLine/productNumber</li>
            <li>/customData/myCustomParameter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Output method call details </h3>
        <p>The path locates a node or set of nodes within the XML returned by the 
 OEAS method (returnXml). Each node so located is called an output node. 
 </p>
        <p>The path can fully utilize any XPath syntax supported by the underlying 
 implementation (often MSXML), including filtering, functions, expressions, 
 etc. In addition, the path can refer to attribute nodes or any other type 
 of node accessible via XPath syntax. </p>
        <p>If the path is relative, it is relative to the parametersReturn node 
 in the return XML and no leading slash (/) is required. </p>
        <p>If the path is absolute, it must start with one of 
 the following strings: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>/returnXml - The output nodes are located in the 
 return XML created by the Transaction Manager. The text after /returnXml 
 is treated as a relative path specifying a node or set of nodes under 
 the returnXml node.</li>
            <li>/returnXml/customData - The customData node is 
 already a part of the return XML, so the valid path starts with /returnXml/customData.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After the initial string, there must be a valid relative Xpath. It is 
 not valid to use /returnXml by itself. </p>
        <p>In the case of a scalar type method call detail, the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Element 
 Path</span> attribute is expected to identify a single node within the 
 return XML. If the XPath identifies multiple nodes, only the first is 
 considered the output node. </p>
        <p>In the case of a list type method call detail, the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Element 
 Path</span> attribute is expected to identify a set of nodes within the 
 return XML. Each node within the set is an output node. </p>
