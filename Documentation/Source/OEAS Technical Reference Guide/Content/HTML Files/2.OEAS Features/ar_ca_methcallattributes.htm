        <h4>Method call attributes </h4>
        <p>Using the Method Call Designer, you set the following method call attributes 
 to map the method call to the OEAS method. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Certain attributes might not be presented in Method Call 
 Designer, depending on the type—“merge template” or “scripts”—of method 
 call you are creating.</p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Name:</b> This attribute is the user-friendly 
 name you provide that is meant to be understood by the method call user 
 (a user of the Templates or Scripting feature). There is no requirement 
 for the name to have any particular relation to the underlying OEAS method, 
 nor is there any requirement that multiple method calls using the same 
 underlying method have similar names. The name can be a maximum of 50 
 characters. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</b> The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span> 
 attribute is the brief description that you provide to explain the use 
 of the method call to the intended method call users. It is meant to assist 
 the method call user in choosing a particular method call. The description 
 can be a maximum of 255 characters. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Object:</b> This attribute identifies 
 the underlying OEAS object whose method is called by the method call. 
 In the Method Call Designer, you select this value from a list of all 
 available OEAS methods. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Method:</b> The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Method</span> 
 attribute identifies the OEAS method that is called by the method call. 
 In the Method Call Designer, you select this value from a list of all 
 available methods for the object that you specified with the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Object</span> 
 attribute. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">When you create a merge template method call, the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Method</span> 
 list excludes well known methods that are not “retrieve” type methods 
 (such as inserts, updates, deletes, and saveCollections). Only “retrieve” 
 type methods are appropriate for merge template method calls. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Input Object:</b> You define the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Input Object</span> attribute only for merge template 
 method calls. Merge template method calls accept the primary ID of only 
 specific types of objects (company, customer, incident, individual, or 
 work ticket), based on the object type enumeration value. The input object 
 you select determines which object’s primary ID is expected for the method 
 call. </p>
        <p>For instance, suppose you are creating a method call that returns an 
 individual’s most recently purchased product. You would select customerProduct 
 as the OEAS object for the method call and retrieveList for the method. 
 However, you would select individual for the input object, because it 
 is the primary ID from the individual object that drives the search for 
 the customer product, based on the relationship of individual.primaryId 
 to customerProduct.ownerId. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Active:</b> The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Active</span> 
 attribute controls whether or not the method call is available for use 
 in the Script Designer or Template Maintenance. </p>
