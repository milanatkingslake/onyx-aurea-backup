        <h3>What are Keywords?</h3>
        <p>A keyword is a word or phrase that an end user associates with an incident, task, or work ticket when they are creating or updating the record. The keyword is used to provide a logical criterion on which users can subsequently search to locate the record.</p>
        <p class="Important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Keywords data is not case sensitive. The keywords “procedure” and “Procedure” are saved as a single instance of a keyword.</p>
        <p>Keywords are saved to the database associated to the specific record with which they were created. In addition, after end users have associated a particular keyword to records of the same type a specified number of times, that keyword becomes a keyword lookup value for all records of that type. This means that subsequently, when a user creates or updates a different record of that same type, that keyword value appears as a lookup value so that users can select it to be associated with the record, rather than having to manually type the keyword.</p>
        <p>The default records that support keywords are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Work ticket</li>
            <li>Incident</li>
            <li>Task</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Keywords for incident and task records are further defined by incident and task categories.</p>
        <p>The number of times a keyword must be used before it becomes a keyword lookup value is determined by a system parameter. For keywords for incidents and tasks, the system parameter is KeywordIncludeCount. For keywords for work tickets, the system parameter is WorkTicketKeyWordIncludeCount.</p>
        <p>The following example demonstrates how a keyword becomes a keyword lookup value.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Example</p>
        <p>Suppose that you have configured the system parameter KeywordIncludeCount with a parameter value of 5. Using the keyword “cancel,” this example shows how the keyword is used for any number of incidents, tasks, and work tickets, but only becomes a keyword lookup value for the record type with which it is associated at least 5 times.</p>
