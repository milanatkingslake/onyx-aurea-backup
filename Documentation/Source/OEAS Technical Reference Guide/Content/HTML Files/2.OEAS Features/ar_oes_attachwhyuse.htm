        <h3>Why use attachments? </h3>
        <p>The ability to attach files of all types is critical to workflow for 
 most businesses. For example, users in technical support need to attach 
 files, code samples, and knowledge-base articles to their support incidents, 
 while sales users need to attach copies of contracts, responses, and competitive 
 information to customer records. </p>
        <p>Following are typical examples: </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Example: Sales opportunity </p>
        <p>A customer purchases stock through a broker. On confirmation of the 
 purchase, the broker sends the trade confirmation document out to the 
 customer, and attaches the document to the Sales Opportunity for later 
 reference. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Example: Support incident </p>
        <p>A customer calls to report an error in a software product he or she 
 purchased. The support technician creates a support incident for the customer, 
 attaches the software patch to the incident form, and sends the form to 
 the customer. The support incident is closed. </p>
