        <h3>User authentication</h3>
        <p>Authentication is the process in which a user is identified by his or 
 her account information and password in order to start a session.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#Login">Login scenarios</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="#Session">Session management</a>
            </li>
            <li><a name="Login"></a>Login scenarios</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are two scenarios under which users log in and are authenticated: </p>
        <p class="Important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Only users whom the Onyx administrator has added as 
 Onyx users in Security Administration can be authenticated to use OEAS.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Integrated Windows authentication</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">The user has an intranet domain account for which integrated Windows 
 authentication is available. </p>
        <p class="Indent1">In this scenario, the user logs in with a domain account name and 
 password. The user is authenticated by Windows domain security, the domain 
 account is mapped to an Onyx user account, and a session is established. </p>
        <p class="ListNote" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Windows authentication is only supported when OEAS and 
 OES are installed on the same machine. Onyx authentication supports physically 
 separate OEAS and OES servers.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Onyx authentication</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">These users typically log in through a Web page with a user ID and 
 password. The user ID and password, which is case-sensitive, constitute 
 the user’s credentials for authentication, and the session is established. 
 </p>
        <h4><a name="Session"></a>Session management</h4>
        <p>In order for user information to be passed between Web sites located 
 on separate physical Web servers, all session information must match. 
 Because the domain account that the IIS server on the calling Web server 
 is passed as part of the authentication process, the authentication fails 
 when the calling domain account doesn't match the domain account that 
 initiated the session. For this reason any Web site that will pass information 
 and user authentication to another Web server before making a call to 
 the middle tier must use the same anonymous user domain account. </p>
        <p>For more information on session management, see the OEAS Developer’s Reference.</p>
