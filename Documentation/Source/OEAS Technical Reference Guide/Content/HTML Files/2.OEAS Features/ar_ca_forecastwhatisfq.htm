        <h2>Forecasts and Quotes </h2>
        <p>A forecast is a document that provides the means to assign a probability 
 to anticipated sales. The forecast contains a price total weighted by 
 both the confidence that a customer will purchase a product(s) and the 
 probability of closing the entire sale. </p>
        <p>A quote is a standard business document that provides a business client 
 with an estimate of the price for a product(s) or service(s). </p>
        <p>Each forecast can have several lines of detail as can each quote. Each 
 forecast line has an associated confidence level for the product under 
 consideration (a likelihood of the sale for that item) in that line. </p>
        <p>Forecasts and quotes are typically associated with a sales incident, 
 although you can also use them with support and service incidents. Each 
 incident can have only one forecast associated with it, but an incident 
 can have multiple quotes associated with it. </p>
        <p>Within the default implementation of OEAS, customers are the owners 
 of incidents‚Äùforecasts and quotes are sub-data to incidents. A forecast 
 or quote is created by associating one or more products to the forecast 
 or quote record of an incident. </p>
