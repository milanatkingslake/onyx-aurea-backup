        <h2>Subscription </h2>
        <p>The Subscription feature is part of the OEAS functionality that enables 
 OEP end-users to copy transactional data to OEP-Offline so that they can 
 access that data while they are disconnected from the network. To take 
 existing data offline, end-users must first subscribe to the data in OEP. 
 Then, after they have synchronized the data with OEP-Offline, they can 
 work with the data in OEP-Offline while disconnected from the network. 
 </p>
        <p>The Subscription feature enables: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Administrators to define OEP end-users as subscribers, 
 who can then subscribe to OEP data and work with it in OEP-Offline.</li>
            <li>Administrators to define OEP end-users as advanced 
 subscribers, who can then subscribe to OEP data on behalf of one or more 
 other offline users.</li>
            <li>Administrators to define the subscribable objects 
 that control which types of OEP transactional data the subscribers can 
 take offline.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The main elements of the Subscription feature are 
 described in the following sections and include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="AR_CA_SubscSubscribers.htm">Subscribers</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="AR_CA_SubscSubscObjects.htm">Subscribable 
 objects</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="AR_CA_SubscRelatRules.htm">Subscription 
 relationships, rules, and roles</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The OEAS offline functionality is supported by the synchronization 
 subsystem of the Onyx Processing Server (OPS). For an overview of the 
 offline functionality, see the <span style="font-style: italic;">OEP-Offline 
 Implementation Guide</span>.</p>
