        <h4>Revising a script that has been published </h4>
        <p>There are several considerations to keep in mind when 
 revising a script that has been published: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you deactivate a script while a script session 
 based on the script is suspended, the end-user who tries to resume the 
 session receives an error. Also, end-users cannot view sessions for inactive 
 scripts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">When you re-activate the script, both of these issues are resolved, 
 but might have already caused problems. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you delete a step, prompt, or rule from a script, 
 then when the script is again available, end-users who review the script’s 
 sessions will encounter an error when they arrive at the deleted or affected 
 step. </li>
            <li>When a prompt is inactive, its responses are not 
 displayed in the end-user interface.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Therefore, to make a script unavailable, do not make 
 it inactive. Instead, in the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Script Edit</span> 
 area, under <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Availability</span>, do one of the following: 
 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uncheck the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Published </span>box.</li>
            <li>Specify a date in the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Effective 
 Date</span> or <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Expiration Date</span> box that excludes 
 the time for which you do not want the script to be available.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, the following are best practices for 
 revising scripts that have been published: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To change text in the script, unselect the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Published</span> box and then reselect it after completing 
 the text changes.</li>
            <li>To delete a step, prompt, or rule from the script:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Sec_List">If you need to save the previous version of 
 the script and its sessions, clone the script, then perform the deletions 
 in the clone. That is to say, create a new script.</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">If you do not need to save the previous version 
 of the script and its sessions, make the changes in the current script.</li>
        </ul>
