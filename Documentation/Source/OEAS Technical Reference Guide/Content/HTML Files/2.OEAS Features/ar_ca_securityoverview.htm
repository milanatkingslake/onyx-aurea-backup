        <h3>User security </h3>
        <p>In OEAS, security services provide user authentication 
 and session management, licensing, and access-permissions management for 
 resources. User accounts are basic to the function of all these services, 
 as follows: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Once authenticated and connected to OEAS, users 
 are the basis of session-state information. After a user is authenticated 
 and a session is established, re-authentication is not required for execution 
 of any subsequent requests during that session.</li>
            <li>Access-permissions management is administered 
 in Security Administration, where access permissions are granted to users.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to users, the elements that OEAS uses to manage security 
 services are sites, applications, roles, and resources. The following 
 section discusses users, roles, and resources in more detail. </p>
