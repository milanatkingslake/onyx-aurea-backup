        <h4>Creating incident territories</h4>
        <p>For the routing of incidents, you can define the following 
 types of incident territories: </p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Incident only territory</li>
            <li>Combined territory</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Incident only territory</h5>
        <p>Incident territories contain one to many incident conditions and zero 
 customer conditions. The first condition that evaluates to true determines 
 which territory an incident is associated with. You can create an incident 
 territory when your business rules for routing incidents do not include 
 properties of the company or individual objects. </p>
        <p>For example, a sales representative requires the ability to track incoming 
 incidents on a daily basis. The business rules do not include customer 
 data for the tracking of incidents. The administrator creates an incident 
 territory and enables only the incident insert process. The incident update 
 process is not used.</p>
        <p>The new incident territory does the following:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Associates incident records with the appropriate 
 territory</li>
            <li>Creates internal contacts for incidents</li>
            <li>Assigns incidents</li>
        </ul>
        <p>During the insert of an incident record, the system evaluates the conditions 
 to see if any internal contacts should be created for the incident or 
 if the incident should be assigned to a particular user.</p>
        <h5>Combined territory</h5>
        <p>A combined territory contains one to many incident conditions <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> 
 one to many company/individual conditions. Incident conditions in a combined 
 territory are only evaluated if the incident's owner is also associated 
 with the territory. The first condition that evaluates to true determines 
 which territory the record is associated with. You can create a combined 
 territory when your business rules for routing incidents include properties 
 of the company or individual object in addition to the incident object.</p>
        <p>For example, a support representative is assigned 
 to resolve incoming support incidents whose company owners are in the 
 High Tech sector. The business rules iarar_ca_anclude customer and incident data. 
 The administrator creates a combined territory to do the following:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Associate individual, company, and incident records 
 with the appropriate territories created for the High Tech sector.</li>
            <li>Create internal contacts for customers and incidents.</li>
            <li>Assign incidents to support engineers in the High 
 Tech sector.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>During the insert of individual, company, and incident records, the 
 system evaluates the conditions to see if the inserted record should be 
 associated with the designated territories. The system also creates the 
 correct internal contact records and for incident records, assigns incidents 
 to the appropriate support representatives.</p>
        <h5>Considerations</h5>
        <p>When you define incident territories, consider the 
 following:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Incident territories are evaluated by the system 
 according to the hierarchy defined in the Assignment Tree. 
 A high-priority incident condition, such as an important sales opportunity 
 will be processed before other incident conditions if it evaluates to 
 true and is at the top of the hierarchy.</li>
            <li>OPM processes are used for the insert and update 
 of incidents, companies, and individuals. You must enable these steps 
 to call whatever processes are appropriate for your business.</li>
            <li>Combined territories require that an incident's 
 owning customer record be associated with the same territory.</li>
        </ul>
