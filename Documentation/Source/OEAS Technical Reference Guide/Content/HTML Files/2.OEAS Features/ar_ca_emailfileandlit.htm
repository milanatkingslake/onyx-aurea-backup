        <h4>Attachments for email messages</h4>
        <p>End users can browse for new files, literature items, and existing files 
 to attach to email messages. After a file or literature item is selected, 
 the physical file is uploaded to the file store and displayed in the end-user 
 interface. </p>
        <p>Files that are attached to an email are uploaded through the browser 
 and stored on a Windows server file share. When a user downloads an attachment, 
 the browser is redirected to the proper location on the file share to 
 obtain the document. The OEAS stores the file locations, and OEP controls 
 the file structure for saving the files. </p>
        <p>The path information for the file share is stored in the FileLocation 
 table of the database. You configure the FileLocation table in OES with 
 Table Administration. For more information, see <a href="../3.Configuring OEAS Features/ar_emailconfigattach.htm">Configuring 
 attachments for emails.</a></p>
        <h5>Configuring literature item attachments for emails </h5>
        <p>Using the Product Administration tool, you can identify literature products 
 that end users can attach to email messages. In the end-user interface, 
 the literature item appears in the Literature Tree as a selectable item 
 on the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Add Literature Attachments</span> page. For 
 more information, see the material on configuring literature in <a href="../3.Configuring OEAS Features/ar_emailconfigattach.htm">Configuring 
 attachments for emails.</a></p>
        <p>The Email feature uses the system parameter <span class="SystemParameter" style="color: #000000;">EmailCreateFileLinkforLit</span> 
 to determine whether to create a fileLink object when a literature item 
 is attached to an email message. For more information on configuring this 
 system parameter, see <a href="../4.Using ONYX Enterprise Studio/oes_syspenalbconvfromt.htm">EmailCreateFileLinkforLit</a> and topics on the <i>fileLink</i> business object in the Business objects library.</p>
