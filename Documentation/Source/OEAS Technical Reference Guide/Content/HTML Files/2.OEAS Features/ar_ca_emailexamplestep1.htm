        <h4>Step 1: Interested customer sends an email to the corporate alias </h4>
        <p>Using their native email client such as Eudora, an individual expresses 
 interest in a new product in an email that he or she sends to the corporate 
 alias posted on the company Web site. </p>
        <p>When the individualâ€™s email arrives, the following 
 happens in OEAS and OPS: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The email monitor subsystem (EMS) finds the email 
 in the corporate mailbox and imports it into OEAS.</li>
            <li>The EMS creates a contact association to the individual 
 based on the email address from which the email was sent.</li>
            <li>The email is flagged for follow-up as specified 
 through the EMS settings in OPS Administration.</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
