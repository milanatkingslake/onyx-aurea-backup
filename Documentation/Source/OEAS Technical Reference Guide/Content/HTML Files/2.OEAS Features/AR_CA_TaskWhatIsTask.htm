        <h2>Tasks </h2>
        <p>You use a task to identify and track one or more assignments that need 
 to be completed in order to address issues that arise from a single incident. 
 The Task feature enables users to create tasks, to assign tasks to other 
 users, and to update tasks either to track progress or to change the scope 
 of the task. Users can also specify when tasks are due and set reminders 
 for them, as well as create work notes with each update to provide details 
 of their progress. Users can also relate tags and internal and external 
 contacts to a task. </p>
        <p>In OEAS, the three default task categories are Sales tasks, Service tasks, and Support tasks. You can configure 
 additional task categories to meet other functional requirements of your 
 organization. </p>
        <p>You can add any number of tasks to an incident. A task:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cannot exist independently; it is always owned 
 by an incident, and the task category must be associated with the incident 
 category.</li>
            <li>Can have any number of work note entries.</li>
            <li>Can have only one reminder.</li>
            <li>Can be assigned to only one user.</li>
            <li>Can have only one primary contact.</li>
            <li>Can have any number of tags.</li>
            <li>Can have any number of file attachments.</li>
        </ul>
