        <h1>Always subscribe the primary object </h1>
        <p>The <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Always subscribe the primary object </span>rule 
 can be set only at the relationship level and is used to provide cascading 
 subscriptions that protect data integrity. It is also used to determine 
 which secondary objects should be unsubscribed or deleted when a primary 
 object is unsubscribed or deleted. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">A default set of subscription relationships with the 
 <b>Always subscribe the primary object</b> rule 
 set to true is provided with installation of OEAS. These relationships 
 are required and this rule should not be modified. For more information 
 about the default required relationships, see <a href="AR_CA_SubscDefaults.htm">Default 
 subscription relationships and rules</a>.</p>
        <p>Setting this rule to true for a subscription relationship ensures that 
 when an end-user subscribes to the secondary object in the relationship, 
 an automatic (cascaded) subscription to the relationship’s primary object 
 is created for that subscriber. In addition, the cascade process checks 
 for this same rule on any relationships of the primary object, and, if 
 found, will subscribe that relationship’s primary object to the subscriber 
 as well. The cascade process continues to auto-subscribe records to the 
 subscriber in this manner until there is no further relationship to process. 
 For example, when the top-level object is reached, when a duplicate (already 
 subscribed) object is reached, or when an object is reached that either 
 does not have a primary object relationship or that does not have a primary 
 object relationship with the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Always subscribe the 
 primary object </span>rule set to true.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">The original subscription to the secondary object can be 
 a result of the end-user explicitly subscribing to the object herself, 
 an advanced subscriber subscribing the object to the user, or another 
 cascade process. In any case, once the subscription is created, the cascade 
 process will proceed as described when this rule is set to true.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Example: </p>
        <p>Suppose you have the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A subscribable company object.</li>
            <li>A subscribable incident object with a subscription 
 relationship between the company and incident objects based on the OEDB 
 <em class="Emphasis">company owner of an incident</em> relationship, for 
 which the <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Always subscribe the primary object </span>rule 
 is set to true.</li>
            <li>A subscribable task object with a subscription 
 relationship between the incident and task objects based on the OEDB <em class="Emphasis">incident owner of a task</em> relationship, for which the 
 <span class="UIElement" style="font-weight: bold;">Always subscribe the primary object </span>rule 
 is set to true.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When an end-user subscribes to a task, an automatic (cascaded) subscription 
 to the incident that owns the task is created for that end-user, as well 
 as a subsequent cascaded subscription to the company that owns that incident.
