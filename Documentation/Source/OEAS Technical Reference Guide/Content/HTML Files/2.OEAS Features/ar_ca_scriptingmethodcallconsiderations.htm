        <h4>Method calls: considerations when using </h4>
        <p>When possible, put method calls that manipulate data (such as update, 
 insert, and delete method calls) or create objects (such as email messages) 
 at the end of the script. When viewing a previous step, all pre method 
 calls are executed and any data modifications (such as sending an email) 
 occur again. </p>
        <p>In a pre method call, do not use a method that modifies data. Instead, 
 call the method in a post method call of the preceding step. If a user 
 returns to a step that contains a pre method call to a method that modifies 
 data, the method can overwrite responses that the user had made when originally 
 completing the step. </p>
        <p>When creating a method call, include method call inputs that provide 
 the method with data that the database requires. Lack of required data 
 causes the method call to fail. </p>
