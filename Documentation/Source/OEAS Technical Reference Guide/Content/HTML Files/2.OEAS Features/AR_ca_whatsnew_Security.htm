        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>Application security is maintained by implementing 
 the following:</p>
        <h4>Principle of least privilege</p>
        <p>In general, the principle of least privileges means that 
 an application is configured to use the lowest and most specific level 
 of permissions required to accomplish its task. The application does not 
 create or require any users to be members of a local or domain administrator 
 or power user group. For more information, see Least 
 privilege overview.</p>
        <h4>File attachments</p>
        <p>Onyx File Agent (OFA) supports file attachments for OEAS 
 client applications. OFA replaces the previous architecture in which the 
 client application directly accessed a Windows file share to read and 
 write attachments. With OFA. the client application calls a COM+ component 
 to store and retrieve file attachments. Only the OFA component needs read 
 and write access to the file share where attachments are stored. The Email 
 Send Step and Email Monitor Subsystem continue to use direct access to 
 the file share for file attachment functionality.</p>
        <h4>Upgraded Email Send Step</p>
        <p>The Email Send Step, responsible for sending 
 email from OEP, has been upgraded to support user ID and password authentication 
 with an SMTP server. This step also supports secure sockets layer (SSL) 
 communication with the SMTP server. SSL is an encrypted form of communication 
 for passing the user credentials over networks. OEAS Configuration Utility 
 enables customers to select any of the following authentication protocols. 
 </p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Anonymous: &#160;no 
 authentication.</li>
            <li>Basic: a hard-coded user 
 ID and password with clear text authentication. Onyx provides a utility 
 for encrypting the password before entering it in the configuration 
 tool.</li>
            <li>NTLM: Windows user credentials. 
 </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Customers can enable SSL with any of these protocols.</p>

        <h4>Session Time-out</p>
        <p>In previous versions, background processes in a client 
 application could prevent a client session from ever timing out, even 
 when the user left the client window idle for extended periods of time. 
 To remedy this issue, the OEAS application includes a new OTM interface 
 which makes session updates optional. In addition there is a new element 
 in the step package XML, passed between logical method calls by the client, 
 called sessionSecondsRemaining. This new element gives the UI information 
 on impending session time-outs. &#160;OEAS 
 administrators configure this feature using the GlobalSessionTimeOut and 
 OEPEnableSessionTimeOut system parameters.</p>
        <h4>Web Services with Windows Authentication</p>
        <p>New virtual directories for Web Services support Windows 
 authentication for distributed applications. Previously, OEAS Web Services 
 only supported Onyx authentication, and the virtual directory names did 
 not reflect any authentication type. Now, OEAS Web Services setup prompts 
 for authentication type, before installing virtual directories. Setup 
 users can select either the Onyx or the Windows authentication types. 
 Depending on the selected type, setup creates one of the following pairs 
 of directories. To use both types of authentication, the user must run 
 the setup program twice, once for each authentication type.</p>

        <h4><a name="Least_privileges_overview"></a>Least privilege overview</p>
        <p>The least privilege principle impacts the following areas and processes 
 of OEAS:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#whats_new_security_OEDB">OEDB Setup and Runtime</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="#OEAS">OEAS Setup and Runtime</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="#OPS">OPS Setup and Runtime</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="#Publishi">Publishing</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="whats_new_security_OEDB"></a>OEDB Setup and Runtime</p>
        <p>OEDB setup requires database owner privileges to create and populate 
 database roles and compile database code. To avoid giving OEDB setup system 
 administrator privileges, an administrator must configure a database owner 
 login manually or with a supplied script. Setup prompts for the user that 
 already has full rights on the target database.</p>
        <p>Setup creates the roles OnyxPublic and OnyxLMViews to restrict access 
 to database resources. Grants of the execute privilege on stored procedures 
 restrict execution to members of the OnyxPublic role. The List Manager 
 user can execute ad-hoc SQL statements, so the procedure that executes 
 List Manager queries (opSearchQueryExecute) uses a special role, OnyxLMViews, 
 restricted to SELECT permission on List Manager views in OEDB. Members 
 of OnyxLMViews are not members of OnyxPublic, so they cannot execute queries 
 on any other stored procedures, functions, or views.</p>
        <p>All stored procedures use an EXECUTE AS SELF syntax that enables <a href="../1.OEAS Architecture Overview/2.What is New/ar_ca_whatsnew_sql_generation_(sqlgen).htm">SQLGen</a> to process 
 SQL statements generated from the OED at run time. The EXECUTE AS SELF 
 syntax causes each statement to execute in the context of the database 
 user that created the procedure (the database owner) rather than in the 
 context of the database user calling the procedure (OnyxEASSql). </p>
        <p>SQLGen never generates dynamic SQL statements composed directly from 
 ad-hoc user input. When dynamic SQL statements are required, SQLGen creates 
 parameterized queries. This approach mitigates any potential for the security 
 flaw known as "SQL injection."</p>
        <p>SQLGen uses a wrapper procedure, opSqlGenWrapper, to call compiled stored 
 procedures and execute generated SQL statements at run time. Because the 
 opSqlGenWrapper procedure can execute dynamic SQL statements that are 
 passed to it, it includes an EXECUTE AS CALLER command. This command causes 
 the wrapper procedure to execute as the OnyxEASSql user and therefore 
 only has permission to execute compiled procedures, functions, and views 
 but not ad-hoc SQL statements based on user input.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="OEAS"></a>OEAS Setup and Runtime</p>
        <p>The OEAS COM+ user is no longer a member of the Power Users group which 
 has more privileges than are required for OEAS to perform its function. 
 The only additional permission this account has beyond "guest" 
 status is the ability to log on as a batch job. </p>
        <p>OEAS uses OnyxEASSql database user for run-time connections to OEDB. 
 As mentioned previously, OEDB setup makes this user a member of the database 
 public role and gives it no other special privilege. However, setup makes 
 the user a member of the OnyxPublic role, giving it permission to execute 
 stored procedures, functions, and views.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="OPS"></a>OPS Setup and Runtime</p>
        <p>By default, the OPS service user's permissions are reduced to the lowest 
 possible level. The Onyx Processing Server (OPS) user is no longer a member 
 of the administrator group on the local machine, unless the customer uses 
 the print fulfillment subsystem. For the print fulfillment functionality 
 to work, the OPS service user must be a member of the local administrators 
 group. If a customer uses the Email Monitor or Synchronization subsystems, 
 the OPS user must be configured as a domain account with access to the 
 appropriate Exchange server.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Publishi"></a>Publishing</p>
        <p>After a customer makes changes to metadata in Onyx 
 Enterprise Dictionary (OED), they publish a working copy to deploy the 
 changes. Because the publish process includes compiling database stored 
 procedures, Object Designer prompts the user for SQL login credentials. 
 This login should have db_owner privileges. This process requires that 
 the OEAS COM+ application be shut down in order to clear memory caches. 
 A COM+ shutdown requires administrator privileges on the local machine. 
 Object Designer implements the publish process, and its user must have 
 sufficient privileges to initiate the publish process. A customer can:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Log into Object Designer 
 using Windows authentication.</li>
            <li>Give the Object Designer 
 web application anonymous user the necessary privileges and log into Object 
 Designer using Onyx authentication.</li>
            <li>Log into Object Designer 
 using Onyx authentication (with default privileges), allow the "stop.COM+" step to fail, and manually perform the OnyxEASApp COM+ restart. 
 For more information on the "stop COM+" step, see OED 
 publish process.</li>
        </ul>
