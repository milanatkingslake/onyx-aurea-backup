        <h4>Why use List Manager? </h4>
        <p>A typical use of List Manager is to build a list of customers who have 
 purchased an item from your organization and for whom you would like to 
 create an additional sales opportunity. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Example: 
 Using List Manager to create a sales opportunity for specific customers</p>
        <p>Suppose your banking organization has a credit card protection service 
 that you want to market to customers who recently opened a Gold Card Visa 
 account with your organization. Using List Manager, users with minimal 
 SQL skills can complete this task, including identifying the specified 
 customers and creating the sales opportunities for each of those customers. 
 </p>
        <p>The following steps describe the process users would follow to complete 
 the task: </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>Identify the view on which you want to base your 
 List Manager search. In this case, the search should return a list of 
 individuals—the individuals for which you want to create the sales opportunities. 
 In List Manager, select the Individuals <em class="Emphasis">search view</em>.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Select search items from the search tables to 
 further define the search criteria:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li class="List_Indent">From the “Product” search table, you can select 
 the search item of Product Number. This is the search item that defines 
 the criteria representing the Gold Card Visa account (product). Because 
 this is an enumerated string type search item, the string operators IN 
 and NOT IN are provided. Selecting IN as the string operator for this 
 search item ensures that only individuals associated with this account 
 are returned in the result set.</li>
            <li class="List_Indent">From the Product search table, you can select 
 the search item of Purchase Date. This is the search item in which you 
 can define the date range for when the account must have been opened for 
 it to fit the criteria required for introduction to the protection service. 
 In this case, the requirement is to create a sales opportunity for all 
 customers who opened an account in December 2001. Because Purchase Date 
 is a DATETIME type search item, the string operator BETWEEN is available. 
 You can define December 1, 2001, and January 1, 2002, as the dates between 
 which the account was opened.</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" start="3">
            <li>Run the List Manager search and select the customers 
 for whom you want to create a sales opportunity.</li>
            <li>Select the sales opportunity <em class="Emphasis">bulk 
 action</em>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Indent1">After you select the bulk action, you are prompted to create a single 
 sales opportunity. Once you save the sales opportunity, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Onyx 
 List Handler</span> creates this sales opportunity for each company that 
 you specified for the bulk action. </p>
        <p class="Indent1">The process of creating the new records (in this example, sales 
 opportunities) is managed by the Onyx List Handler. The actual time that 
 the records are created is determined by configuration settings in this 
 service. </p>
        <ol style="list-style: decimal;list-style-type: decimal;" start="5">
            <li>If you want to save the List Manager search for 
 later use, save the search as either private or public. You might want 
 to save the search if you plan to run it on a recurring basis. You might 
 want to save it as public if you want the search to be available to other 
 users. </li>
