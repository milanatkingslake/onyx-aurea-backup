        <h3>OnyxNatLangCache component </h3>
        <p>The OnyxNatLangCache is an OEAS core component that supports high-performance 
 string retrieval for OEAS. At run-time, the OnyxNatLangCache creates a 
 read-only, in-memory copy of the National Language strings that you have 
 customized and the remaining default OEAS strings. This in-memory copy 
 is called the OnyxNatLangCache. The OnyxNatLangCache greatly improves 
 performance by eliminating the need to read data from disk and the need 
 to make frequent calls to the database. See <i>Setting national language information</i> for further details. </p>
        <p>Before the strings that you have customized in Table Administration 
 can appear in the end-user interface, you must refresh the cache so that 
 the most recent copy of the strings can be loaded in memory. Refreshing 
 the cache requires that you unload the OnyxNatLangCache by shutting down 
 several OEAS COM+ applications on the application server. The next time 
 you log on to OEAS, the new National Language strings will be refreshed 
 in the cache.</p>
