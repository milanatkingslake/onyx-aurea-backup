        <h3>Using surveys: an example </h3>
        <p>Suppose the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Global Technologies sells two software products, 
 Product A and Product B. </li>
            <li>Jane Thompson, a marketing executive at Global 
 Technologies, needs customer self-profiles in order to differentiate customers 
 by:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Sec_List">Which of products A and B they use</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">How they use them and how much benefit they 
 realize using these products</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">The markets and world segments that they target</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Based on what Jane learns from the customer self-profiles, 
 she will customize marketing campaigns for each group. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Jane could use the Survey Administration tool in Onyx Enterprise Studio 
 to create a survey with the following question hierarchies. </p>
        <p>In the following diagram, diamond shapes are questions, rectangles are 
 responses, and ovals are editable responses. </p>
        <p class="Image">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/AR_Srvys_QHier.jpg" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #000000;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #000000;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #000000;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #000000;" />
        </p>
        <p>Jane takes the following steps to create this survey 
 (for information on performing these tasks, see Help for Survey Administration 
 in the OEAS Administrator’s Reference): </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a survey type named “Self-profile.”</li>
            <li>In the “Self-profile” survey type, create a survey 
 named “Region 3 customers.” </li>
            <li>In the survey, create the following survey questions, 
 question responses, and question hierarchy:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Sec_List">Survey question: Which Global Technologies 
 product do you use more actively?<br />		Question responses: Product A, Product B<br />		Question type: Single<br />		This survey question’s responses start a pair of question hierarchies, 
 one for each answer.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Sec_List">Survey question: Where do you use Product 
 A?<br />		Question responses: Centrally, In multiple locations<br />		Question type: Single<br />		Whichever question response the respondent picks, the next survey 
 question in the hierarchy is the same: “What features would you like to 
 see added to Product A?”</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">Survey question: Who mostly uses Product B?<br />		Question responses: Managers, Line workers<br />		Question type: Single<br />		Whichever question response the respondent picks, the next survey 
 question in the hierarchy is the same: “What features would you like to 
 see added to Product B?”</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">Survey question: What features would you like 
 to see added to Product A?<br />		Question responses: Feature #1, Feature #2, Other features. The 
 question response “Other features” is editable.<br />		Question type: Multiple<br />		However the respondent answers, the next survey question in the 
 hierarchy is the same: “In which markets do you use Product A?”</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">Survey question: What features would you like 
 to see added to Product B?<br />		Question responses: Feature #1, Feature #2, Other features. The 
 question response “Other features” is editable.<br />		Question type: Multiple<br />		However the respondent answers, the next survey question in the 
 hierarchy is the same: “In what world segments do you use Product B?”</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">Survey question: In which markets do you use 
 Product A?<br />		Question responses: Direct, Channel, Both<br />		Question type: Single<br />		Whichever question response the respondent picks, the next survey 
 question in the hierarchy is the same: “How much do you save monthly with 
 Product A?”</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">Survey question: In what world segments do 
 you use Product B?<br />		Question responses: Western Hemisphere; Europe, Middle East, Africa; 
 Asia Pacific<br />		Question type: Multiple<br />		Whichever question response the respondent picks, the next survey 
 question in the hierarchy is the same: “How much do you save monthly with 
 Product B?”</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">Survey question: How much do you save monthly 
 with Product A?<br />		Question responses: Less than $10,000; $10,000-$50,000; More than 
 $50,000<br />		Question type: Single<br />		This is the last survey question in one branch of the question 
 hierarchy.</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">Question: How much do you save monthly with 
 Product B?<br />		Question responses: Less than $10,000; $10,000-$50,000; More than 
 $50,000<br />		Question type: Single<br />		This is the last survey question in one branch of the question 
 hierarchy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After Jane completes the survey, she: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Obtains customer responses with a client application 
 (OEP, OCC, or a custom application).</li>
            <li>Uses the List Manager feature of OEP to group 
 respondents by:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li class="Sec_List">Product usage</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">Market</li>
            <li class="Sec_List">Monthly sales</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Compiles the answers to product-feature requests 
 as captured by the answers to the free-text “Desired features?” survey 
 question.</li>
        </ul>
