        <h3>Permissions management </h3>
        <p>Managing access permissions is the second major aspect of OEAS security. 
 Access permissions enable users to view or work with required data and 
 tools, and enable you to limit users’ access to sensitive data, objects, 
 and tools. </p>
        <p>Security Administration is the tool for matching users with access permissions 
 for various objects. The objects are represented in Security Administration 
 as resources, which fall into three predefined resource groups: Business 
 Objects, UI Resources, and Other Resources. </p>
        <p>For more information on managing access permissions with Security Administration and on the Security Administration tool, see “Using Security Administration” in the OEAS Administrator’s Reference and the Help for Security Administration.</p>
