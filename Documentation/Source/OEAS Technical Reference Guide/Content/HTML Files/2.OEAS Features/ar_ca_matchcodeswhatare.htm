        <h3>What are match codes</h3>
        <p>A match code is a string that is made up of various fragments of data 
 from a customer record that might uniquely identify it. For instance, 
 portions of a companyâ€™s name and primary address might uniquely identify 
 a company. If two customer records have the same match code, that might 
 be an indication of duplicate records.</p>
        <p>In general, a simpler match code enables you to catch more duplicate 
 records, and a complicated match code results in fewer duplicates being 
 caught. You can configure the match code feature to meet the requirements 
 of your business.</p>
        <p>By default, two formulas for generating match codes are included in 
 OEAS: one for individuals and one for companies. For more information, 
 see "Configuring OEAS features," <a href="../3.Configuring OEAS Features/ar_matchcodeconfig.htm">Match 
 Code</a>.</p>
