        <h3>What is a campaign? </h3>
        <p>A campaign is a grouping of events that you want to monitor for statistical 
 or informational purposes. Campaigns are frequently implemented in order 
 to help your organization achieve a goal, but they can also be implemented 
 simply so you can monitor events, such as who has attended a specific 
 training course. By monitoring activities, you can measure the progress 
 and, often, the overall effectiveness of an endeavor. </p>
        <p>The campaign feature consists of: </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Campaigns -</b> The name of an activity 
 (or group of events) that you want to monitor. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Tracking codes -</b> The identifier 
 for a specific event or activity (such as a specific mailing, seminar, 
 or advertisement) that is part of a campaign. Tracking codes can be linked 
 to incidents, products, and literature order records to track the tracking 
 code’s influence in the selling process. A tracking code can only be assigned 
 to one campaign. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Tracking code types -</b> Logical groupings 
 of the types of events that are described by tracking codes. Tracking 
 code types help you organize tracking codes used for one or more campaigns. 
 Note that tracking code types are independent of campaigns—they do not 
 link campaigns to tracking codes. </p>
        <p><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Tracking code milestones 
 -</b> These enable end-users to define actions for each tracking code 
 in a campaign, and include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Milestone categories 
 -</b> The categories you define for tracking code milestones.</li>
            <li><b class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Milestone actions 
 -</b> The individual actions required to meet milestones.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Together, the milestone category and milestone action are the components 
 of a tracking code milestone. The individual milestone categories and 
 milestone actions that are created in Campaign Administration can be reused 
 to create new tracking code milestones across many tracking codes. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Campaigns, tracking code types, tracking codes, and tracking 
 code milestones are created and maintained through Campaign Administration.</p>
