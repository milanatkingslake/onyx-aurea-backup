        <h4>Step 2: Task Manager searches for inbound flagged emails </h4>
        <p>The sales manager uses Task Manager to search for 
 all inbound emails flagged for follow-up, and performs the following tasks: 
 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creates a sales incident for the email from the 
 individual customer and links the email to the sales incident.</li>
            <li>Creates a non-contact association (link) to the 
 individual and his or her company. The link enables all emails in the 
 thread to appear on the individual record and company record (even if 
 the individual or company is not a sender or recipient of a particular 
 email in the thread). </li>
            <li>The manager assigns the sales incident to a sales 
 representative for follow-up with the individual.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the end-user interface: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The email message appears on the individual, company, 
 and sales incident history pages.</li>
        </ul>
