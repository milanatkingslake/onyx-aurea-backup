        <h3>Why use campaigns? </h3>
        <p>A typical use of a campaign is to track a related group of marketing 
 activities. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Example:<span style="x-text-overline: off;x-text-line-through: off;text-decoration: none none none;"> 
 Campaign as a tracking tool for a marketing activity</span></p>
        <p>Suppose that you want to create a marketing campaign to encourage your 
 customers to use your online banking service. You call this campaign Online 
 Banking Promotion. </p>
        <p>You decide to advertise your online banking service in five different 
 ways (these are your tracking codes): with an advertisement placed on 
 your company's Web site; with an advertisement placed on your partner 
 company's Web site; with an advertisement in the local weekly paper; with 
 an advertisement placed in the local Sunday paper; and with a promotional 
 postcard sent to your current valued customers in the mail. </p>
        <p>After you determine how to advertise your online banking 
 service, you logically arrange the events into three groups (your tracking 
 code types): </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Internet Ads: The advertisements being placed 
 on your company and partner company's Web sites. </li>
            <li>Newspaper Ads: The advertisements in the local 
 weekly and Sunday newspaper. </li>
            <li>Direct Mailer: The promotional postcard (it does 
 not fall into the same category as the advertisements, so it gets it own 
 category).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember that these tracking code types are independent of your Online 
 Banking Promotion campaign. After you create these tracking code types, 
 you can associate any number of tracking codes with them, and you can 
 associate them with any number of campaigns. Additionally, you can associate 
 tracking code milestones with a tracking code to manage the specific actions 
 required to meet the goals of the campaign. </p>
        <p>For example, if your company were to offer a Free Checking Promotion, 
 you could use these same tracking code types again, but the specific tracking 
 codes and their associated tracking code milestones must be different. 
 </p>
        <p>Your campaign would be organized like this: </p>

        <p>The campaign feature enables you to monitor the effectiveness of your 
 Online Banking Promotion campaign at any time. When a customer subscribes 
 to your online banking service, not only is their customer data entered 
 into the database, but so is the tracking code—that is, the name of the 
 advertisement that encouraged them to use your online banking service. 
 By running a report based on your campaign, you can measure the effectiveness 
 of each of your marketing activities (tracking code types), and the overall 
 effectiveness of your campaign. You might discover that Internet Advertising 
 was the most effective marketing activity and that the Direct Mailer was 
 the least successful. With this information, you will be better equipped 
 to launch your next promotion. </p>

        <p>Campaigns can also be used for statistical or informational purposes. 
 For example, campaigns can be used internally to track which of your employees 
 have attended a specific training program. Here the campaign could be 
 organized like this: </p>
