        <h4>Creating contacts for customers and incidents</h4>
        <p>When creating contacts for customers and incidents, 
 consider the following:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Internal contacts for customers and incidents 
 are automatically created on the insert of customer and incident records 
 in the database. </li>
            <li>During the update of customer records, only the 
 association between a company or individual and the associated territory 
 is updated. </li>
            <li>During the update of incident records, the association 
 between the incident and the associated territory is updated and the incident 
 is optionally re-assigned. For more information, see <a href="ar_assignstudioassignmentsets.htm">Assigning 
 incidents</a>.</li>
            <li>Unlike the company and individual update process, 
 the incident update process is not configured to run on every incident 
 update. By default, it only runs when an OEP 
 user manually assigns an incident to the Auto Assign user. For more information, 
 see the <a href="ar_ca_assignstudioaboutproccond.htm">Manual assignment 
 of incidents</a>.</li>
        </ul>
