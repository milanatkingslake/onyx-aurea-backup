        <h4>Rules </h4>
        <p>A rule is a link between two steps in a script. A rule identifies the 
 next step in the script to display after completion of the current step. 
 When there multiple next steps possible, the current step must contain 
 at least one rule pointing to each of the next steps. In this situation, 
 each rule except the last one must contain a condition statement. The 
 condition statements for each of the rules are evaluated in the order 
 in which they are sequenced. The first rule with a true condition statement 
 determines the next step in the script to be displayed. </p>
        <p>A condition is a logical expression which must evaluate to true or false. 
 A condition usually contains script variables and logical operators. For 
 example {age} &gt; 21 is a logical condition that evaluates to true when 
 a person's age is greater than 21. For advanced users, a condition is 
 an XPATH expression which can contain XPATH operators. </p>
        <p>Unless you are familiar with XPATH syntax, you should use only the following 
 operators to build conditions: AND, OR, NOT, (), =, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, 
 &gt;=, and &lt;&gt;. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">Use &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, and &lt;&gt; only for numerical 
 comparisons. You cannot use them to make comparisons with strings.</p>
