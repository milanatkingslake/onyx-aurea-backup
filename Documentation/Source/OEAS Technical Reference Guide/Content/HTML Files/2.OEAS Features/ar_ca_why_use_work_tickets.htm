        <h3>Why use work tickets? </h3>
        <p>Although you can use the Work Tickets feature for 
 many purposes, two typical uses are to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Track the discovery and resolution of product 
 errors, using the work ticket as a quality assurance tool.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">Although a product error or enhancement request can result from 
 a sales, service, or support incident, the issue might not be resolved 
 at the same time that the incident is resolved and closed. You can create 
 a work ticket to track work on the issue after the incident is closed. 
 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Track a project that affects multiple customers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Indent1">When a project must be completed for many customers, you can manage 
 the entire project from a main source, the work ticket, while the task 
 for each customer is tracked and managed by an individual incident. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Example:<span style="x-text-overline: off;x-text-line-through: off;text-decoration: none none none;"> 
 Product quality assurance</span></p>
        <p>Suppose a customer reports a problem with “View 2.1,” a software product 
 your organization sells. The support technician creates a support incident 
 for the customer and assigns it to the support engineer to investigate 
 the nature of the problem. On investigation, the support engineer discovers 
 the problem has resulted from a product flaw, so he creates and supplies 
 a patch to the customer. Having resolved the customer’s immediate problem, 
 the support engineer closes the support incident. However, because he 
 has identified a flaw in the product, he creates a work ticket, links 
 it to the product View 2.1 by that product’s association to the incident 
 product “Assistant Tools,” and assigns it to a development engineer. </p>
        <p>Once the support engineer creates the work ticket, the engineering group 
 can prioritize the problem and track its resolution. The engineer can 
 update the work ticket, saving work notes about the issue, options for 
 fixing it, and final resolution. He can record the priority, status, and 
 severity of the issue in the work ticket, while the audit-log automatically 
 saves the history of changes to these attributes over the life cycle of 
 the work ticket. </p>
        <p>In addition, at any point in the cycle, end users can associate the 
 work ticket with the customer who identified the error, with the support 
 incident that was created for the customer, or with both. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Using this combination of incident and work ticket, the customer’s immediate 
 problem can be addressed on a separate time line from resolution of the 
 product error. In this case, your company might supply the customer with 
 a software patch several months prior to releasing the next version of 
 the product that incorporates the same fix. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Example:<span style="x-text-overline: off;x-text-line-through: off;text-decoration: none none none;"> 
 Multiple customer project</span></p>
        <p>Suppose, as a marketing associate, you must contact all of your customers 
 that currently own a product to market to them a newer version of that 
 product. You can accomplish this by creating a work ticket to organize 
 and track the project as a whole, and then create associated sales or 
 service incidents for each customer that you must contact. When all of 
 the associated incidents have been closed, you can close the work ticket, 
 completing the project. </p>
        <p>One benefit to organizing the project in this manner is that you can 
 delegate the work of contacting the customers to other marketing associates 
 by assigning the individual sales or service incidents to them, while 
 you maintain ownership of the project, as represented by the work ticket.
