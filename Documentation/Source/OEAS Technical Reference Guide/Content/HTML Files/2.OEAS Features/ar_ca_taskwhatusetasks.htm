        <h3>Why use tasks? </h3>
        <p>Suppose that a Service incident requires your organization to modify 
 the way in which your network interacts and communicates with one of your 
 customer's networks. Obviously, resolving this incident requires more 
 than one simple task, and likely requires several people to help resolve 
 this incident. The Task feature enables you to track the many different 
 tasks that can comprise a single incident. You can create any number of 
 tasks for an incident, assign each task to a different individual, and 
 track each task separately. End-users can specify when tasks are due and 
 set reminders for them. A client application can retrieve the tasks that 
 an incident owns and examine their statusId properties to determine what 
 progress is being made on the incident. </p>
