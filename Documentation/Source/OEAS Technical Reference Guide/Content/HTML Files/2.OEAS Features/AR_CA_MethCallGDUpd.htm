        <h4>Updates </h4>
        <p>Update method calls are supported by the Scripting feature and are always 
 preceded by retrieval method calls, since you must first retrieve the 
 object you wish to update. When you design an update method call you must 
 also carefully design the retrieval method call. </p>
        <p>The retrieval method call must return all the properties of the object 
 that the update method call subsequently passes. For instance, the retrieved 
 object must return the primaryId and the onyxTimestamp (for objects that 
 support locking), because these are required properties for an update. </p>
        <p class="Important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"> If the object you want to update does not support partial 
 updates, the retrieval method call must return all the properties of the 
 object, because all of those values must be sent with the update method 
 call even if the method call is not designed to update those values.</p>
