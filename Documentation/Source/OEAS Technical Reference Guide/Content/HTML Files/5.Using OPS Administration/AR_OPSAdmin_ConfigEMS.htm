        <h2>Working with email monitor subsystems and monitored&#160;mailboxes 
 </h2>
        <p>Email monitor subsystems (EMSs) monitor configured mailboxes on network 
 mail servers at set intervals for inbound mail. EMSs process and assimilate 
 inbound emails into the database. Using information such as the sender 
 and recipient email addresses and an internal thread identifier, the EMS 
 associates inbound email with companies, individuals, Onyx users, and 
 customer records. </p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">EMS does not support Transport-Neutral Encapsulation Format (MS-TNEF or TNEF) or rich-text format (RTF) for email messages. When an OEP user opens a message that was sent in one of these formats, any TNEF- or RTF-formatted text in the message body does not appear.</p>
        <p>You can configure an EMS to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitor a corporate email account, such as a generic 
 sales, service, or support inbox. </li>
            <li>Monitor an email account set up in conjunction 
 with the Onyx Email for Outlook inbox. Onyx Email for Outlook is a plug-in 
 for Microsoft Outlook with which end-users can save messages into the 
 database from their personal Outlook inboxes and track new messages sent 
 from their personal account in OEP. For more information, see <a href="AR_OPSOutlookAddinmb.htm">Adding 
 and configuring a mailbox for Onyx Email for Outlook</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An EMS can also: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create contact associations (links) to individual, 
 company, and incident records related to an email.</li>
            <li>Create non-contact associations (links) to emails 
 associated with individual, company, and incident records unrelated to 
 the sender or receiver of the email.</li>
            <li>Flag new emails for follow-up so they can be reviewed 
 by internal users.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Following are the tasks that you carry out to configure 
 and manage EMSs and monitored mailboxes and to control the OPS service 
 and subsystems. </p>
