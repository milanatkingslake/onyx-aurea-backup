            <MadCap:keyword term="Location of resource files;Resource files:Location of" />Location of the resource files</h1>
        <p>During setup, resource files for features from previous versions are 
 installed into the [YourOEPwebsite]\Res 
 directory. The file structure of the Res folder mirrors the structure 
 of the [YourOEPwebsite] folder, 
 with files grouped by feature.</p>
        <p>The names for resource files are identical to the name of the script 
 file to which the strings belong, but with the suffix res appended to 
 the file name. For example, the resource file for workticket_core.vbi 
 is named workticket_core_res.vbi. Every script file that generates user 
 interface text has a corresponding resource file.</p>
        <p>Resource files for new features and those that use the result list control 
 and other onyxCommon components are installed in a directory in [YourOEPwebsite]\ that identifies the 
 language in use. The English version stores the files in [YourOEPwebsite]\eng. 
 The directory structure for these resource files matches that of the application, 
 but the files themselves are named to reflect their purpose. This was 
 done as the strings may be used by several different script files simultaneously 
 rather than tied to a single script file. </p>
        <p>ASP scripts that use resource files reference them with the #include 
 directive. The following example shows how the surveydetails.asp script 
 includes surveys-details_res.asp, and how the reference to a caption string 
 is made within the surveydetails.asp file.</p>
        <p>The file surveydetails.asp references surveys-details_res.asp:</p>
        <p Class="Code" class="code"><!-- #include file="res/surveys-details_res.asp"--></p>
        <p>Within the ASP code, the text for the caption of the Survey Question 
 column is taken from the value of the variable:</p>
        <p Class="Code" class="code"><td class="ColumnHeader">%=res_Survey_Question%</td></p>
        <p>The caption is defined as a constant in surveys-details_res.asp:</p>
        <p Class="Code" class="code">const res_Survey_Question = "Survey Question"</p>
        <p>Some client-side files have resource strings 
 stored in JavaScript and VBScript files. The naming conventions are the 
 same as those used for ASP files. </p>
