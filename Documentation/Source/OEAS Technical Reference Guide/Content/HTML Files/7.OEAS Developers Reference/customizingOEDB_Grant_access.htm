 to the database object:</p>
        <p Class="Code" class="code">GRANT EXECUTE ON &lt;cpMyProcedure&gt; TO 
 OnyxPublic</p>
        <p>Grants will also be necessary for creating functions that return a table:</p>
        <p Class="Code" class="code">GRANT SELECT ON &lt;cfMyFunction&gt; TO OnyxPublic</p>
        <h4>OnyxLMViews</h4>
