            <MadCap:keyword term="allowInitialValue" />allowInitialValue property</h2>
        <p>The allowInitialValue property of the <a href="scriptControlType_object.htm"><MadCap:keyword term="scriptControlType" />scriptControlType</a> 
 object specifies whether a control can be bound to a literal or variable 
 input value.</p>
        <h3>Data type</h3>
        <p>Boolean</p>
        <h3>Access</h3>
        <p>Read/write</p>
        <h3>Remarks</h3>
        <p>For some controls such as checkBox, the script designer might want to 
 assign a default value to save the user some time on input. The designer 
 does this using an input value or input variable whose value is bound 
 to the control when it is rendered in the script step. Suppose you have 
 a prompt that asks whether the customer wants to receive email updates 
 about products. The designer wants the checkBox associated with this prompt 
 to be checked by default, because most customers want to receive such 
 emails. He can set the initial value of the checkBox to 1 (literal value), 
 and the checkbox appears checked when it is rendered in the user interface. 
 For a scriptControlType to support such input binding, the allowInitialValue 
 property must be set to true (1).</p>
