        <h1>Resource files</h1>
        <p>Strings for column headings are manipulated by using the XResourceManager 
 object. Each XListControl instance of a list must have a resource manager 
 object attached to it for the column headings to appear in the list. These 
 strings can be loaded from a file on the server or created dynamically 
 at run time. </p>
        <p>Almost all OEP lists that use XListControl have their column headings 
 generated automatically from the data provided by OEAS. See <i>Auto-generating 
 column headings</i> for more information on doing this with custom lists. 
 </p>
        <p>Once the list has been rendered, changes to the strings in the resource 
 manager have no effect on the rendered list.</p>
