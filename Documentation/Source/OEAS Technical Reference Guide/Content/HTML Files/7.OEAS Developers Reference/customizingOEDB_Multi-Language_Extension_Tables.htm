            <MadCap:keyword term="Multiple Language Support" />Multiple language support</h3>
        <p>If you are modeling a domain object that requires multiple language 
 support, you can accomplish this through SQL generation by following a 
 few design considerations. You will need to create a <a href="customizingOEDB_Extension_Table.htm">multi-language 
 extension table</a> that is related to your <a href="customizingOEDB_Base_Table.htm">base 
 domain table</a> according to specific rules, as well as a <a href="customizingOEDB_Multiple_Language_View.htm">multiple 
 language view</a>.</p>
        <p>Multi-language domain data is persisted in a one-to-many table relationship 
 that stores many descriptions (one for each possible preferred language) 
 for a single code or DID (domain identifier) value. The multiple language 
 view provides a single database object that can be queried on to retrieve 
 all of the appropriate data. SQL generation automatically filters the 
 data of the view by the user's preferred language so that the language-appropriate 
 description is displayed by the user interface.</p>
        <p>The <a href="customizingOEDB_Multiple_Language_View.htm">multiple 
 language view</a> should join the base table and the multi-language extension 
 table on a join on the primary key columns of the base table. You should 
 create the metadata describing this view using the Object Designer, as 
 if the view were a table. However, in the Object Designer be certain to 
 check the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Multi Language Table</span> 
 box for both the multi-language extension table and the view. </p>
