        <p>OEAS setup installs a working copy of OED, along with a registry key 
 that points to its location. Object Designer edits it and publishes it. 
 When you <a href="Publishing_your_changes_to_the_OED.htm">publish</a> 
 this working copy, it replaces the production copy.</p>
        <p>An <span style="font-weight: normal;">abridged OED</span> that the Onyx 
 Data Manager uses to generate T-SQL code at runtime. This copy is created 
 when you publish changes to the OED.</p>
        <p>The Object Designer creates a working copy of the OED file so that you 
 can customize it without directly affecting the production copy. When 
 you save your changes to the OED, the Object Designer saves the changes 
 to this working copy. None of your changes are transferred to the production 
 copy until you publish your changes to the OED.</p>
        <p>When you <a href="Publishing_your_changes_to_the_OED.htm">publish</a> 
 your changes, the Object Designer overwrites the production copy (OnyxEnterpriseDictionary.xml) 
 with the contents of the working copy <span style="color: #000000;">(OnyxEnterpriseDictionaryWC.xml)</span>. 
 After you publish your changes, the working copy and the production copy 
 of the OED are identical. The working copy is not deleted or otherwise 
 removed, and it is used the next time that you make modifications to the 
 OED. Only one working copy exists at a time.</p>
        <p>Since the OTM communicates with the OED cache, 
 and not the actual OED source file, the changes that you make to the production 
 copy of the OED (by publishing those changes) are not actually implemented 
 until the OED cache is refreshed. To refresh the OED cache, you must restart 
 OEAS. </p>
