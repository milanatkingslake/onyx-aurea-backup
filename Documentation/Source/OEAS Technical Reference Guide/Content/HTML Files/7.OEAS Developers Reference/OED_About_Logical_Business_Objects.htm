            <MadCap:keyword term="About Logical Business Objects" />Logical Business Objects</h4>
        <p>The logical business objects collection is the parent collection that 
 holds all metadata describing the logical structures on the business tier, 
 as well as the logical-physical information that associate entities in 
 the business tier with entities in the data tier.</p>
        <p>Each business object is an entity that can 
 (1) hold data and/or (2) perform work. OEAS business objects are objects 
 in the true OOP sense. They encapsulate data in properties and expose 
 methods to perform work related to the data they hold and the relationships 
 they have with other objects. Individual attributes of an object are a 
 unique name, a description, and some other information mostly related 
 to validity and version control. In this release of the OED, object inheritance 
 is not supported. </p>
