            <MadCap:keyword term="Overview" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" />Modifying a method</h4>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Methods" />Existing methods can be modified for customization. Modifying methods 
 can be useful for adding custom steps to an existing business object, 
 as this sample demonstrates.</p>
        <h4>Scenario</h4>
        <p>This sample demonstrates how to modify an existing method to include 
 a call to a custom step component. This is useful for performing custom 
 steps within an existing method. This custom step will return additional 
 information when the retrieve method is called for a company business 
 object.</p>
        <h4>Guidelines</h4>
        <p>Changing existing methods can result in unpredictable 
 behavior, or even failure, of the business object. The following guidelines 
 are do's and don'ts for modifying methods.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some method step attributes must never be modified. 
 Attributes for existing step methods such as Name and Step Type must never 
 be changed.</li>
            <li>Steps are typically added to a method, but they 
 can also be removed. Removing steps from existing business object methods 
 may result in method failure.</li>
            <li>Write down the method 
 steps, and the attributes of those steps, that you are about to modify 
 before making your changes. If your changes result in incorrect behavior, 
 you will need to restore the method steps to their original settings.</li>
        </ul>
