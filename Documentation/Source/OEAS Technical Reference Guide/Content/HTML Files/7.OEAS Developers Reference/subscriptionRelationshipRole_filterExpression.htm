        <p>The filterExpression property of the <a href="subscriptionRelationshipRole_object.htm"><MadCap:keyword term="subscriptionRelationshipRole" />subscriptionRelationshipRole</a> 
 object contains an expression used in a WHERE clause that limits the secondary 
 objects subscribed to according to the roles that the subscribing user 
 is a member of.</p>
        <h3>Data type</h3>
        <p>string</p>
        <h3>Access</h3>
        <p>Read/write</p>
        <h3>Remarks</h3>
        <p>When a user is a member of more than one role, the WHERE clause can 
 have more than one filter expression. The comparison operator is additive 
 for the expressions.</p>
        <p>When the user does not belong to a role that has a subscriptionRelationshipRole 
 defined for the subscriptionRelationship to which a subscribed object 
 belongs, the cascade method uses the contents of the defaultFilterExpression 
 property of the subscriptionRelationship object.</p>
