        <p>The National Language (NatLang) feature supports customization and localization 
 of strings used by the Onyx Enterprise Application Server (OEAS). At run-time, 
 the OnyxNatLangCache contains a working copy of both the strings that 
 you customize and the remaining default OEAS strings. You can use the 
 Table Administration tool of the Onyx Enterprise Studio to customize strings 
 in the database. These strings can be utilized without having to recompile 
 components. </p>
        <h4>
            <MadCap:keyword term="OnyxNatLangCache component" />OnyxNatLangCache component</h4>
        <p>The OnyxNatLangCache supports high-performance string retrieval for 
 OEAS. At run-time, the OnyxNatLangCache component creates a read-only, 
 in-memory copy of the strings that you customize and the remaining default 
 OEAS strings. This in-memory copy is called the OnyxNatLangCache. The 
 cache is accessible through two interfaces, one for step components (<a href="NatLang_Cache.htm">INatLangCache</a>) and the other for client applications 
 (<a href="NatLangProxyIntro.htm">NatLangProxy</a>). Each of these interfaces 
 exposes two methods for retrieving strings from the cache. The OnyxNatLangCache 
 greatly improves performance by eliminating the need to read data from 
 disk and the need to make round-trips to the database.</p>
        <p>The OnyxNatLangCache dynamic link library (DLL) contains the implementation 
 of the OnyxNatLangCache component. OEAS loads the DLL into the COM+ process 
 space the first time the Onyx Transaction Manager or another component 
 needs to retrieve a string. When the DLL loads, the OnyxNatLangCache component 
 creates the in-memory cache and an instance of the OnyxNatLangCache COM 
 object. The DLL and the cache remain loaded in the process space of the 
 OEAS COM+ application package for the lifetime of the OEAS application. 
 After localizing or customizing strings, you must restart the OnyxEASApp 
 COM+ application to refresh the cache and enable the changes to appear 
 in the UI.</p>
