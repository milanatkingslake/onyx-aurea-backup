        <h5>refreshData attribute</h5>
        <p>OEAS uses the refreshData attribute to indicate that data input through 
 a client user interface has been modified by some business logic, before 
 it was written to the database. Your OEAS client application can use this 
 attribute to determine if it is necessary to retrieve the new data before 
 displaying results.</p>
        <p>OEAS attaches the refreshData="1" attribute to an object node, 
 within the parametersReturn XML, to indicate that a property on the object 
 has been modified during an insert or update process. In addition, OEAS 
 sets the methodStatus to successWithInfo and returns an appropriate message 
 in the methodStatus XML. </p>
        <p>The refreshData attribute does not apply to properties that are objects 
 or collections, since child objects and collections have their own refreshData 
 attribute. If a collection has a refreshData attribute set to "1", 
 that means the collection saved has a different set of objects than those 
 passed in.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Example</p>
        <p>If the data inserted needs to be refreshed, OEAS attaches the refreshData 
 attribute (with a value of "1") to the appropriate object node 
 in the parametersReturn XML. The following sample code illustrates an 
 object node with this attribute set.</p>
        <p class="code">&lt;myObject objectType="myObject" content="keysOnly" <span style="color: #800000;">refreshData="1"</span>&gt;</p>
        <p class="code">&#160;&#160;&#160;&lt;myObjectId&gt;120&lt;/myObjectId&gt;</p>
        <p class="code" style="margin-bottom: 0;">&lt;/myObject&gt;</p>
