            <MadCap:keyword term="COM+ settings;Settings;COM" />COM+ settings</h4>
        <p>This section lists the settings that are required for the Onyx Enterprise 
 Application Server (OEAS) components in order to implement a common security 
 policy and to allow transparent integration between the Onyx Transaction 
 Manager, the step components, and OEAS security components. The settings 
 also enable optimal system performance. The default COM+ settings provide 
 a standard level of security for OEAS and should not be altered.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the COM+ security settings is to ensure that only legitimate 
 applications and components can call the OEAS components.</p>
        <p>The settings listed in this section are accessible through the Component 
 Services administration tool provided with the Microsoft Windows. These 
 settings are automatically applied when the OEAS is installed and configured.</p>
        <p>When you create custom COM+ components and integrate them with OEAS, 
 apply the same COM+ settings that <a href="DAC_Prop.htm">Onyx step components</a> 
 have.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;"> If you reinstall OEAS, you must again add custom step components 
 using Component Services. Also, you must reapply any changes to the default 
 COM+ settings of Onyx core components and Onyx step components.</p>
        <p>OEAS has two COM+ applications: OnyxEASApp 
 and OnyxEASLib. All settings for the applications, components, interfaces, 
 and roles are provided in this section. </p>
