            <MadCap:keyword term="Unsupported Modifications to the OED;Supported Modifications to the OED;OED;Supported/Unsupported OED modifications" />Supported/Unsupported OED modifications</h4>
        <p>Prior to making modifications, determine which business objects are 
 used by the Onyx Enterprise Studio tools and any other user interfaces 
 so that you know what is affected by the modifications.</p>
        <h4>Supported Modifications</h4>
        <p>When you use the Object Designer to create custom business objects, 
 Onyx expects you to complete all necessary attributes for your custom 
 objects and specify its presence in the physical model and object physical 
 maps.</p>
        <p>Because OEAS is predominately data-driven, it is imperative that the 
 OED is accurate. OEAS uses the logical model, physical model, and the 
 mappings of the OED for most of its operations. An incorrect OED leads 
 to unpredictable behavior and method failures.</p>

            <MadCap:keyword term="Data-Driven Attributes" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Non-Data-Driven Attributes" />Non-Data-Driven Attributes</h3>
        <p>Onyx supports the modification of the following attributes in the OED, 
 since these attributes are not data-driven in this version of OEAS:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Modifying the description of an item. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span> field is used primarily 
 for documentation and maintenance purposes. OEAS does not rely on the 
 value of this attribute.</li>
            <li>Identifying whether the item has been released. 
 The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Released</span> field is used primarily 
 for documentation and maintenance purposes. OEAS does not rely on the 
 value of this attribute.</li>
            <li>Identifying who installed the item. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">InstalledBy</span> field is used primarily 
 for documentation and maintenance purposes. OEAS does not rely on the 
 value of this attribute. However, Onyx may use this field during upgrades 
 of OEAS.</li>
            <li>Identifying a custom version number for a modified 
 object. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Custom Version</span> field 
 is used primarily for documentation and maintenance purposes. OEAS does 
 not rely on the value of this attribute.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Data-Driven Attributes</h3>
        <p>Onyx supports the modification of the following attributes in the OED. 
 However, because these attributes drive the behavior of platform components, 
 you must understand the impact of modifying them. For more information 
 on attributes, see <a href="OED_Overview.htm">OED Concepts</a>.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Step Type, Step Data, Additional Data, Procedure Maps, and Sort Property 
 attributes</p>
        <p>The values of the step type and step data are passed to the step components 
 as a parameter of the Execute method of the IStep interface, which is 
 the primary client call into the OEAS middle tier. If these values are 
 not correct, the execution of the client call fails. The additionalData 
 attribute is also passed to the step component identified by ProgID identified 
 in the step data attribute. Some of this information is intended to be 
 redundant: the values for individual component items (stepName, stepMethod, 
 stepObject, and so on) should be in agreement with the corresponding OED 
 elements. For more information, see the <a href="OED_Methods.htm">Methods</a> 
 section of OED Concepts.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Property attributes</p>
        <p>Onyx supports changing the default value of <a href="OED_Property_Constraint.htm">property 
 constraints</a>, changing the default primary key and how it is generated, 
 and defining properties as denormalized. A denormalized property definition 
 identifies a relationship that enables the retrieval of the denormalized 
 property value. For more information, see the <a href="OED_Property.htm">Properties</a> 
 section of OED Concepts.</p>
        <h4>Object Relationship attributes</h4>
        <p>The OED defines object relationships, identifying the primary and secondary 
 objects, the properties involved, and the relationship type. The type 
 determines how a delete affects related objects. For more information, 
 see <a href="OED_Relationships.htm">Relationships</a> in OED Concepts.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Physical Model attributes</p>
        <p>The OED describes the data tier, both physical structures and procedures 
 used on the data tier. You can define tables, columns, database actions, 
 rules for row filtering, and rules for data security. For more information, 
 see the <a href="OED_About_the_Physical_Model.htm">Physical Model</a> 
 in OED Concepts.</p>
        <h4>Unsupported modifications</h4>
        <p>Onyx does not support the following modifications to the OED:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Any modifications made directly to the OED source 
 file (OnyxEnterpriseDictionary.xml). You must use the <a href="Using_the_Object_Designer.htm">Object 
 Designer</a> to customize the OED. Customizing the OED directly can produce 
 unexpected results.</li>
            <li>Any modifications made to objects that do not 
 display in the Object Designer, such as "businessObjectDefinition." 
 These objects are system objects integral to the OEAS architecture. Customizing 
 the system objects can break core OEAS functionality.</li>
            <li>Any modifications to the row, rowSet, and columnDefinition 
 objects.</li>
            <li>Any modifications made to the default OEAS objects, 
 properties, methods, parameters, and steps, other than the supported modifications 
 listed above. Whenever you customize default OEAS objects, test your customizations 
 in a test environment before <a href="Publishing_your_changes_to_the_OED.htm">publishing</a> 
 them to your production environment.</li>
            <li>Do not disable default OEAS business objects, since doing to will 
 severely impact OEAS functionality. You should enable and disable only 
 custom objects and methods.<p>When you <a href="Disabling_items.htm">disable 
 an item</a> and <a href="Validating_Changes_to_the_OED.htm">validate your 
 changes</a>, the Object Designer informs you of all broken cross-dependencies 
 resulting from the disable. <a href="Resolving_cross_dependencies.htm">Resolve 
 all cross-dependencies</a> before publishing your changes. </p></li>
        </ul>
