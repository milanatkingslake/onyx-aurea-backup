        <p>The tables collection is a container that holds all of the table definitions 
 for the Onyx Enterprise Database (OEDB).</p>
        <p>A table entity is metadata describing a physical database table or view. 
 The table contains a collection of columns, a collection of database actions, 
 and its own specific attributes. In addition to versioning information, 
 the table entity has attributes for a name which must be unique within 
 the database, a description, as well as two specialized attributes. </p>
        <p>The first special attribute is "extends table." When the current 
 table is an extension table, this attribute is used to identify the base 
 table being extended. </p>
        <p>The other specialized property is "multi-language 
 table." This attribute indicates that a table is an extension table 
 designed for multi-language support. Multi-language tables have a unique 
 key that includes a field for language code in addition to the full primary 
 key of the base table. </p>
