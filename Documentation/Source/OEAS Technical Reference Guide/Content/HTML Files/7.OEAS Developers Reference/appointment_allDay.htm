            <MadCap:keyword term="allDay" />allDay property</h2>
        <p>The allDay property of the <a href="appointment_object.htm">appointment</a> 
 object indicates whether the appointment is scheduled to take place for 
 the entire scheduled day.</p>
        <h3>Data type</h3>
        <p>boolean</p>
        <h3>Access</h3>
        <p>Read/write</p>
        <h3>Remarks</h3>
        <p>When set to true, the allDay property affects the startDate and endDate 
 properties of an appointment object as follows: Outlook sets the start 
 to 12:00am of the starting day and sets the end to 12:00am of the day 
 after the ending day. For example, with an all day event for the 15th 
 the startDate property is set to 12:00 am on the 15th and the endDate 
 property is set to 12:00 am on the 16th.</p>
