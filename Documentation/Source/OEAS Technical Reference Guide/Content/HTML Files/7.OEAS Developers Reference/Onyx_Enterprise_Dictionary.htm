        <p>The Onyx Enterprise Dictionary (OED) is an XML file that contains metadata 
 that defines the structure and content of both the business services tier 
 and the data services tier, as well as the relationships between the two 
 tiers. </p>
        <p>The metadata, coded in XML, includes:</p>

        <h4>How the OED is used</h4>
        <p>The <a href="OTM.htm">Onyx Transaction Manager</a> (OTM) uses the data 
 in the OED to process client requests. The OTM accesses the data from 
 cached version of the OED called the <a href="OEDCache.htm">OED cache</a>. 
 The OED cache is loaded into memory the first time a client makes a method 
 call to the OTM. For additional details about the role of the OED in OEAS, 
 see <i>OEAS data flow</i>.</p>
        <h4>Modifying the OED</h4>
        <p>If you plan to <a href="Customizing_Overview.htm">customize OEAS</a>, 
 you will almost certainly need to modify the OED. You can modify the OED 
 using <a href="Customizing_Overview.htm">Object Designer</a>, a design 
 tool in the Onyx Enterprise Studio. When you modify the OED using Object 
 Designer, you are actually modifying a second copy of the OED, or a <a href="OED_working_copy.htm">working copy</a> of the OED; this ensures 
 that the production version of the OED remains isolated from your modifications 
 until you are ready to publish them. When you're satisfied with your modifications, 
 you <a href="Publishing_OED_customizations.htm">publish your modifications</a> 
 to the <a href="OED_production_copy.htm">production copy</a> of the OED. 
 The production copy of the OED contains the XML metadata that populates 
 the OED cache for use by the OTM. </p>
        <p>At any one time, then, as many as three copies of the OED may exist: 
 the read-only in-memory OED (OED cache), the production copy, and a working 
 copy. The production copy and working copy are physical XML files stored 
 on disk. </p>
