        <p>OEAS is both configurable and customizable.</p>
        <p>Configuring means making changes to domain data that drive application 
 logic. Configuration changes generally affect an aspect of the application 
 without changing core functionality. Configuring rarely requires you to 
 write custom code. Adding new contact types and tracking code types are 
 examples of configuring an application. You can configure OEAS using the 
 administration tools in the Onyx Enterprise Studio.</p>
        <p>Conversely, customizing means creating new or changing existing application 
 logic. Customization changes can affect how the entire application functions. 
 Customizing typically involves making significant changes to existing 
 business objects, and often involves extending the functionality of a 
 product by creating and implementing your own business objects. You can
 customize OEAS by using the <a href="Object_Designer_Help.htm">Object 
 Designer</a> to modify the contents of the Onyx Enterprise Dictionary 
 (OED) and/or writing code to effect new logic. </p>
