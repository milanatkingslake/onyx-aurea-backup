            <MadCap:keyword term="Execution process (building step components)" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" />Process</h4>
        <p>Once the structure of the input data has been confirmed, 
 the step component must process the data. The step component may</p>
        <ul>
            <li>transfer data to or from the Onyx Enterprise Database</li>
            <li>transfer data to or from an external database</li>
            <li>perform some operation on the input or output 
 XML</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Processing" />Keep in mind that transferring data affects performance. You should 
 minimize database calls for better performance. Given the flexibility 
 of the Microsoft Component Services architecture processing can include 
 almost any conceivable functionality.</p>
        <h4>Map object properties to database columns</h4>
        <p>For the Onyx Enterprise Database, you map object properties to database 
 columns using the Object Designer. The Onyx Enterprise Dictionary contains 
 declarative data for logical objects, physical model (database table and 
 procedure information), and logical to physical mapping. The DataManager 
 component handles the standard methods (delete, insert, retrieve, retrieveCollection, 
 saveCollection, update) for any objects and properties declared in the 
 OED. For an external database, your step component would need to contain 
 the connection and database logic for the external database.</p>
        <h4>Client state data</h4>
        <p>Objects within the OEAS COM+ application are paired with client applications 
 only for the duration of the method call and not for the lifespan of the 
 client connection. Once the Execute method of the IStep interface completes, 
 the continued existence of the step component object is at the discretion 
 of the COM+ server. For this reason, any step component that intends to 
 maintain state for a client application (or perform asynchronous operations) 
 must do so by persisting relevant information in a database or other storage 
 mechanism. When the client calls the same or a related method again, the 
 step component can retrieve the relevant state information and continue 
 processing normally.</p>
        <h4>Participate in a COM+ transaction</h4>
        <p>By using the COM+ Services library, a step 
 component that supports transactions can check to see if it is currently 
 executing within a transaction stream. If so, the component can alter 
 its behavior if necessary to take advantage of the transaction environment.
