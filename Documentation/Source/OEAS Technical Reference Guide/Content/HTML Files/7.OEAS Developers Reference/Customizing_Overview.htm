        <p>To facilitate integration and customization, OEAS makes extensive use 
 of XML (Extensible Markup Language). The Onyx Enterprise Studio, which 
 complements the OEAS, hosts the administration and design tools that help 
 you configure and customize the middle tier.</p>
        <p>The application programming interface (API) exposed by the Onyx Enterprise 
 Application Server enables developers to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Create custom user interfaces to the Onyx Enterprise Application Server platform.</span>OEAS ships with Onyx Employee Portal. You can, however, design custom user interfaces to access the customer data that you need, and to display that data to your users in a manner that is most usable and efficient for your business. Your custom user interfaces can be rich clients (Win32 applications) or thin clients (browser-based applications). Virtually any client can function with OEAS, as long as it uses XML for data exchange, and as long as it supports COM.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Integrate OEAS 
 with other enterprise applications. </span>OEAS, in conjunction with the suite of ONYX products, is designed to help you manage all of your customer data, whether it be front-office customer data or customer data that resides in other enterprise applications such as accounting, billing, and order-entry systems. The Onyx Enterprise Application Server provides a flexible customization framework that enables this type of integration without requiring you to modify and redistribute your client applications.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Implement 
 custom business rules for managing and storing customer data. </span>The 
 Onyx Enterprise Application Server implements business rules using the 
 Onyx Enterprise Dictionary. This dictionary stores the definitions of 
 the business objects, methods, properties, and relationships. Using a 
 design tool called the <a href="Object_Designer_Help.htm">Object Designer</a>, you can add additional properties to these objects, as well as modify the behavior of these objects. For example, you can modify the company.insert method to perform custom actions like saving data to a custom location, sending an email to a specific user, and so on. You can even create entirely new objects and integrate them with OEAS to function with core components and business objects.</li>
