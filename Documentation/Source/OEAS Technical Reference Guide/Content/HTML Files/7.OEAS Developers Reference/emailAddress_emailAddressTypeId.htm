        <p>The emailAddressTypeId property of the emailAddress 
 object contains a numerical ID associated with a emailAddress type.</p>
        <h3>Data type</h3>

        <h3>Access</h3>

        <h3>Remarks</h3>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="phones" />The emailAddressTypeId is unique per customer. A customer can have numerous 
 email addresses but only one email address with a specific emailAddressTypeID. The emailAddressTypeID 
 refers to the type of email address.</p>
        <p>The emailAddressTypeId property is used to indicate a type description from 
 the database. The default emailAddressTypeId maps to a description such as "email 1", 
 "email 2", "email 3" and so on. The emailAddressTypeId property is a 
 numerical ID that can be configured using the Reference Table administration 
 tool. </p>
        <p>Attempting to create a emailAddress object with the same ownerId and emailAddressTypeId 
 as an existing emailAddress object results in a failure with an error message 
 "A email address of this type already exists for this customer."</p>
        <p>Updating a customer's primary email address to a emailAddressTypeId that already exists 
 as an alternate email address results in a switching of the primary email address and 
 the alternate email address. This functionality allows the user to easily change 
 which email address is primary and which is an alternate.</p>
        <p>This is property is required for the insert 
 or update action of a emailAddress object. </p>
