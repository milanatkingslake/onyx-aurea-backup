        <p>The addressTypeId property of the <a href="address_object.htm">address</a> 
 object contains the numerical ID associated with an address type.</p>

            <MadCap:keyword term="addresses" />The addressTypeId is unique per customer. A customer can have numerous 
 addresses but only one address with a specific addressTypeId. The addressTypeId 
 refers to the type of address.</p>
        <p>The addressTypeId property is used to indicate a type description from 
 the database. The default addressTypeId maps to a description such as 
 "Billing", "Business", "Home", or "Visiting". 
 The addressTypeId property is an integer value that can be configured 
 using the Reference Table administration tool. An example of an addressTypeId 
 might be 102, which could have a description of "Business" in 
 the reference objects or 101410, which could have a description of "shipping".</p>
        <p>Attempting to create an address object with the same ownerId and addressTypeId 
 as an existing address object results in a failure with an error message 
 "An address of this type already exists for this customer."</p>
        <p>This is property is required for the insert 
 or update action of an address object. </p>
