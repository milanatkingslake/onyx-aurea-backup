        <p>The processedDate property of <a href="actionBatch_object.htm">actionBatch</a> object contains the date on which the batch was processed.</p>
        <h3>Data type</h3>
        <p>dateTime</p>
        <h3>Access</h3>
        <p>Read/Write</p>
        <h3>Remarks</h3>
        <p>The processedDate property is set only once when the batch is first processed. Attempts to change this value are ignored. The processedDate value is created by the database during the initial process. The database obtains the date value from the database server clock. The database converts the date value to  UTC date before saving it.</p>
