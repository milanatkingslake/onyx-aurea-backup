        <h2>scheduledProcessDate property</h2>
        <p>The scheduledProcessDate property of <a href="actionBatch_object.htm">actionBatch</a> object contains the date on which the batch process is expected to begin.</p>
        <h3>Data type</h3>
        <p>dateTime</p>
        <h3>Access</h3>
        <p>Read/Write</p>
        <h3>Remarks</h3>
        <p>The scheduledProcessedDate property is set only once when the batch is scheduled to process. Attempts to change this value are acceptable only before the batch is processed. The scheduledProcessedDate value is created by the database during the initial scheduled for the process.</p>
        <p>If this attribute is NULL, then the action batch is processed as soon as possible. If this attribute is NOT NULL, then the action batch is processed on or after the scheduled process date.</p>
