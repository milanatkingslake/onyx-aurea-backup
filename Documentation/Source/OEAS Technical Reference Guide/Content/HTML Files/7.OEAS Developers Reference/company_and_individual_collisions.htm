            <MadCap:keyword term="individual collisions;company" />company and individual collisions</h5>
        <p>The collision handler uses the customer algorithm when it processes 
 company and individual collisions. The company and individual objects 
 consist of a set of customer data (name, company type, title, and so forth), 
 a collection of phone data, and a collection of address data. Among the 
 phones and addresses, there is one primary phone number and one primary 
 address. For the purpose of examining collisions, the customer algorithm 
 couples the customer data with the primary phone and address. This means 
 that a change to a primary phone or address is also a change to the customer 
 data. Note that OEP also saves customer data when alternate phones are 
 changed, so a change to any phone number online can cause a conflict, 
 even if no other customer data was changed.</p>
        <p>The conditions listed below are the circumstances during synchronization 
 cycles that cause the OEP-Offline client and the synchronization subsystem 
 to call the collision handler to process company and individual collisions.</p>
        <p>The default collision handler settings of the company and individual 
 objects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The algorithm type is customer.</li>
            <li>The collision handler ignores maintenance properties 
 and other read-only properties. Ignoring certain properties increases 
 the number of collisions that are resolved without user intervention. 
 For details about the ignored properties, see <i>Subscription Designer Help.</i></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Conditions:</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> The customer data and primary phone and 
 address of the offline and online versions are identical. There are differences 
 between the two versions only in the read-only properties and maintenance 
 properties.</span>
