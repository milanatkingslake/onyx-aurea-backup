               <h2>Customizations affect calling clients</h2>
        <p>Before you customize OEAS and/or the OEDB, remember that OEAS serves 
 as a CRM development platform for a variety of products, including OEP, 
 OES, and OPP. Each of these applications uses many of the same logical 
 objects, step components, and stored procedures. Note that because OEAS 
 is a platform, modifying any of the existing logical objects, step components, 
 or stored procedures can affect other applications that use the platform.</p>
        <p>For example, if you modify the insert method of the individual object 
 by passing it several custom parameters and designing it to call a custom 
 step component, the changes will affect both OEP and OPP-and any other 
 application that calls the individual.insert method.</p>
        <p>If you decide to customize existing OEAS components, such as logical 
 objects or step components, test your modifications thoroughly, testing 
 all applications that call OEAS, before implementing the customizations 
 in your production environment. Onyx recommends that you test your changes 
 at each tier (data tier, business logic tier, and presentation tier) separately, 
 and then that you test them together, in an integrated test environment.
