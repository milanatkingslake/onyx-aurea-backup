        <p>The phoneTypeId property of the <a href="phone_object.htm">phone</a> 
 object contains a numerical ID associated with a phone type.</p>

            <MadCap:keyword term="phones" />The phoneTypeId is unique per customer. A customer can have numerous 
 phones but only one phone with a specific phoneTypeId. The phoneTypeId 
 refers to the type of phone.</p>
        <p>The phoneTypeId property is used to indicate a type description from 
 the database. The default phoneTypeId maps to a description such as "Main", 
 "Direct", or "Fax". The phoneTypeId property is a 
 numerical ID that can be configured using the Reference Table administration 
 tool. An example of a phoneTypeId might be "110" which could 
 have a description of "Fax" in the reference objects, or "111" 
 which could have a description of "Toll Free".</p>
        <p>Attempting to create a phone object with the same ownerId and phoneTypeId 
 as an existing phone object results in a failure with an error message 
 "A phone of this type already exists for this customer."</p>
        <p>Updating a customer's primary phone to a phoneTypeId that already exists 
 as an alternate phone results in a switching of the primary phone and 
 the alternate phone. This functionality allows the user to easily change 
 which phone is primary and which is an alternate.</p>
        <p>This is property is required for the insert 
 or update action of a phone object. </p>
