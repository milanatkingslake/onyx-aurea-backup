        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="OED" />The Onyx Enterprise Dictionary (OED) is a significant part of the Onyx 
 Enterprise Application Server (OEAS). The information stored in the OED 
 is metadata used by all the OEAS core components. In order for the core 
 components to call any customizations (COM components, stored procedures, 
 database customizations, or LBO customizations), the customization must 
 be described in the OED. For example, if you add a column to a table, 
 you need to describe it (in the <a href="OED_About_the_Physical_Model.htm">physical 
 model</a>) and add a property to the corresponding object (in the <a href="OED_About_Logical_Business_Objects.htm">logical 
 model</a>). Or, if you write a stored procedure, you need to describe 
 and map the procedure within the OED. Because of the components dependency 
 on the OED, it is imperitive to have a thorough understanding of how the 
 OED is composed and all the interdependencies of the metadata. By having 
 this understanding, you can take full advantage of the customization opportunities 
 that OEAS has to offer. Attempting to customize without this knowledge 
 could introduce errors into the user interface or data tier.</p>
        <p>The OED metadata describes two types of structures: the logical structures 
 on the business tier and physical structures on the data services tier. 
 The logical business objects collection is the parent collection that 
 holds all metadata describing the logical structures, as well as the logical-physical 
 information that associate entities in the business services with entities 
 in the data services. The physical model collection is the parent collection 
 that holds all metadata describing the physical database structures and 
 code used by OEAS on the data services.</p>
        <p>The OED data store is customizable using the 
 <a href="Object_Designer_Help.htm">Object 
 Designer</a>, which presents the contents of this data store in a <a href="OED_Metadata_Organization.htm">logical 
 structure</a>. This document discusses the meaning and use of the various 
 entities of the OED. </p>
