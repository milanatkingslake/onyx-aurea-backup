        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="addresses" />The address object contains all the information about primary and alternate 
 addresses that are associated with a customer record. The address object 
 is a sub object of addresses. These objects may be saved with the customer 
 or may be saved separately.</p>
        <p>Related to the address object is a property called addresses. The &#160;property 
 has a data type of "object" and, as such, is a representation 
 of a collection of address objects. This collection is referred to as 
 the addresses under the company and individual objects. The addresses 
 object is not defined as a separate object but is merely a collection 
 of address objects. It has no properties or methods, but rather is a property 
 of the object (company or individual) that owns the collection.</p>
        <p>The primary address and the non-primary (alternate) addresses are stored 
 in the address table.</p>
        <p>The address object has one key property, primaryId, that uniquely identifies 
 the address in the database. Once the object is created, the value of 
 this property cannot be changed.</p>
