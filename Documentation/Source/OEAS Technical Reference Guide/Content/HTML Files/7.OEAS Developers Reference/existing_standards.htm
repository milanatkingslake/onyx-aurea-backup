        <h5>Existing standards</h5>
        <p>There are a number of existing and emerging XML and XML-related standards. 
 <span style="font-weight: normal;">Of these emerging standards, OEAS follows 
 </span>the standards established by the W3C<span style="font-weight: normal;"> 
 and uses a lowerCamelCase naming system similar to the one outlined in 
 BizTalk's standards. Both of these standards, and OEAS's application of 
 these standards, are described below.</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>W3C (www.w3.org)</i>-The World 
 Wide Web Consortium is the leader in establishing Web technology standards. 
 The base specifications are XML 1.0, W3C Recommendation Feb '98, and Namespaces, 
 Jan '99. These standards are the foundation for the XML used throughout 
 the industry, and specifically for the OEAS architecture.</li>
            <li><i>BizTalk 
 (biztalk.org)</i>-BizTalk was developed by a number of industry commerce 
 leaders, primarily Microsoft, to define document-oriented business-to-business 
 (B2B) information exchange guidelines. The OEAS does not use or conform 
 to this standard directly because the BizTalk model is document oriented, 
 rather than the object oriented<span style="font-weight: normal;"> model 
 that OEAS uses. Onyx does, however, follow a naming convention similar 
 to BizTalk's CamelCase naming convention. In OEAS, all names use lowerCamelCase.</span></li>
