        <p>Each logical property defined in the OED, includes 
 a propertyConstraints collection, that can contain a propertyConstraint 
 of type required. If the property includes this type of constraint, the 
 property is a required property. When a client calls an insert or update 
 method for an object that contains one or more required properties, the 
 method must pass a value for each required property. You can never pass 
 a required property with the <a href="null_Attribute.htm">null attribute</a> 
 set to 1. You cannot pass a required property as empty except in the following 
 instances.</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>If there is a default value for the property, 
 you can pass required properties as empty (or missing) on insert.</li>
            <li>You can pass required properties as empty (or 
 missing) on update, which would constitute a partial update.</li>
            <li>For an insert method that passes database-generated 
 keys, such as primaryId. In that case, the required field can be passed 
 without a value (such as &lt;primaryId /&gt;), since the database generates 
 the value upon the record insertion.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can use the Object Designer to identify properties as required or 
 not required.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &#160;">In the Object Designer, do not change a propertyConstraint 
 of type 'required' for any OEAS property shipped by Onyx. If you do, you 
 can break compatibility with applications like Onyx Enterprise Studio 
 and Onyx Employee Portal.</p>
        <p>The required constraint instructs OnyxDataValidationStep component to 
 verify that clients pass values for these properties. If you use the Object 
 Designer to designate other Onyx properties as required, the data validation 
 step also verifies that these properties contain values when the property 
 is passed by a client.</p>
        <p>OnyxDataValidationStep component checks the 
 required constraint only for insert and update methods. It ignores the 
 constraint for all other methods.</p>
