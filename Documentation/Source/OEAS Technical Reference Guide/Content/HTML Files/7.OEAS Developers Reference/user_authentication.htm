            <MadCap:keyword term="Windows authentication" />When setting up Onyx user accounts, you must configure how each user 
 will be authenticated to use OEP. OEP offers two types of authentication: 
 You can either force users to log in to OEP with a specific user ID and 
 password (using Onyx authentication), or you can allow them to bypass 
 the logon screen entirely (using integrated Windows authentication).</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Onyx authentication</span> 
 – Using Onyx authentication, users must log on to OEP each time they launch 
 the application by supplying their OEP user name and password. To use 
 Onyx authentication, users must have an Onyx user account (which does 
 not need to be mapped to a Windows domain account).</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Integrated 
 Windows authentication</span> – Using integrated Windows authentication, 
 users can bypass the OEP logon screen entirely. They are not required 
 to log in to the OEP application separately, because the system identifies 
 them using their existing Windows account. To use integrated Windows authentication, 
 users must have a Windows domain account that is mapped to their Onyx 
 user account. When users launch OEP, Windows authentication maps the domain 
 account to that Onyx user account automatically.</p>
        <p class="Note">OEP supports both types of authentication and creates a virtual 
 directory for each during Setup. After installing OEP, you can decide 
 to use either or both of these types of authentication. To administer 
 permissions to certain OEP functionality, 
 or resources, use OES Security Administration. For more information on 
 security, refer to <a href="../1.OEAS Architecture Overview/6.What is Onyx Enterprise Studio/AR_CA_OESWhatIsOES.htm">Administer Onyx Enterprise Studio (OES)</a>.</p>
        <p>OEP integrates with the Onyx Security and Licensing Framework (OSLF), 
 a sophisticated security and licensing model exposed by OEAS. With OSLF, 
 you can grant permissions at multiple security levels, and you can enable 
 some users to connect using Onyx-based authentication and others to connect 
 using Windows-based authentication. OSLF also manages user sessions, exposing 
 an object model that automatically handles connection persistence. </p>
