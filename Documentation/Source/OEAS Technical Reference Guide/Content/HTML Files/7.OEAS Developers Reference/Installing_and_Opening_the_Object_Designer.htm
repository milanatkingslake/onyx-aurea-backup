        <h3>Installing and opening the Object Designer</h3>
        <p>The Onyx Setup program installs the Object Designer as part of the Onyx 
 Enterprise Studio (OES) installation. If Object Designer is not installed 
 you must run the OES setup program from your CD</p>
        <p>By default, when the Object Designer is installed, security is set to 
 allow access only to a user in the administrator role. Security for the 
 Object Designer can be configured using Security Administration. For more 
 details on configuring security, see the <span style="font-style: italic;">Administrator's 
 Reference</span>.</p>
