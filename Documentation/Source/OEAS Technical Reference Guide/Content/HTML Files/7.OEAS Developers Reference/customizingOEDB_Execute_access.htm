        <p>All database objects are created with a single user that has been designated 
 as the database owner. (This user is granted the db_owner role for the 
 database when the user is created.) Given the access rights granted to 
 this user by the db_owner role, there are times when a procedure created 
 by this user should be run under a user with rights that are more limited 
 than that of the database owner. SQL Server 2005 has implemented a new 
 feature that allows the execution context of a procedure to be defined 
 when the procedure is compiled. </p>
        <p>Onyx has used this feature to restrict access between two classes of 
 stored procedures: those that perform actions on the database that are 
 known when the procedure is compiled and those where the actions are unknown 
 when a procedure is compiled. </p>
        <h4>Compiled with known action</h4>
        <p>When you know that you can trust the results of compiling a stored procedure 
 on the database, compile them with the WITH EXECUTE AS SELF specification</p>
        <p>An example of a known action may be a select statement written against 
 the individual table for a retrieveList method. In this case, any user 
 with access to the retrieveList method should be allowed to execute this 
 select statement. No additional restrictions are needed for the execution 
 context, so the procedure may be executed under the context of the Onyx 
 db_owner user that created the procedure: </p>
        <p Class="Code" class="code">CREATE PROCEDURE &lt;cpMyProcedure&gt; (...)</p>
        <p Class="Code" class="code">WITH EXECUTE AS SELF</p>

                        <p class="TableText"><b>Note</b>: When compiling custom stored procedures for OEAS with the 
 WITH EXECUTE AS SELF specification, be sure to compile them using either 
 the 'OnyxDBO' or 'sa' logon ID and follow all other security standards 
 published in this guide. Otherwise, the stored procedure will generate 
 an error when executing.</p>

        <h4>Compiled with unknown action</h4>
        <p>An example of an unknown action may be a procedure that accepts an ad-hoc 
 query string, which it then executes. In this case, we want to only limit 
 the actions that the ad-hoc query string may perform. For instance, we 
 may only want the procedure to run under the context of a user who may 
 only execute select statements against a fixed set of views: </p>
        <p Class="Code" class="code">CREATE PROCEDURE &lt;cpMyProcedure&gt; (...)</p>
        <p Class="Code" class="code">WITH EXECUTE AS &lt;User&gt;</p>
        <p Class="Code" class="code">For example, the List Manager query execution 
 stored procedure, opSearchQueryExecute, is granted access during OEDB 
 setup to a limited database login (by default: OnyxLMSql).</p>
