        <p>All Onyx components that communicate with Onyx Enterprise Database use 
 the <a href="Query_Engine.htm">Onyx Query Engine</a> to communicate with 
 the Database. The Query Engine was built using Microsoft's OLE DB technology. 
 Onyx recommends that custom step components use the Onyx Query Engine 
 to communicate with the Onyx Enterprise Database, but custom step components 
 are free to use any technology they choose to communicate with a database 
 server.</p>
        <h4>Using the Onyx Query Engine</h4>
        <p>The Onyx Query Engine simplifies the process of connecting to the Enterprise 
 Database by storing the relevant connection information in the application 
 server's registry. The connection data is placed in the registry during 
 OEAS installation and can be updated using the OEAS Configuration Utility. 
 A step component need only submit an application name, and the Query Engine 
 handles the process of connecting to the database server by reading the 
 connection information directly from the registry.</p>
        <p>The Query Engine's optimizations provide efficient access to the standard 
 Onyx database schema. As a result, the Query Engine cannot be used to 
 connect to non-Onyx databases. Review the Query Engine documentation for 
 information on using it within a custom step component.</p>
        <h4>Using other data access technologies</h4>
        <p>You'll need to use a different data access technology when you want 
 to connect to a non-Onyx database, or when you need to move unsupported 
 data types in or out of custom tables in the Onyx database. The only requirement 
 for using a different technology is that it must be usable through COM+. 
 One such technology is Microsoft's ActiveX Data Objects (ADO).</p>
        <p>Because you are not using the Onyx Query Engine, 
 and because step components are paired with client applications only for 
 the duration of the Execute method call, a step component may have to 
 reconnect to the database each time it is called depending on the approach 
 you use to database connections. When the IStep_Execute method completes, 
 the component may have to close the connection and free up any other database 
 resources it is using. </p>
