            <MadCap:keyword term="denormalized properties" />Properties that you display on one object but are maintained by another 
 object are called denormalized properties. Sometimes you want to display 
 information from a related object as if it were a property on the current 
 object. For instance, an object may have a "statusId" property 
 and you want to display that value in conjunction with a description that 
 interprets the status code. In this case, you create a "statusDescription" 
 property on your object and specify that it is a denormalized property. 
 For this to work, you must have a <a href="workingWithOed_Creating_relationships.htm">relationship</a> 
 specified in the OED that links the object that maintains the status description 
 to your current object. For your denormalized property, you use the OD 
 to specify the relationship and the target property (the "description" 
 in our example). SQL Generation uses this denormalization definition during 
 retrieve and retrieveCollection methods.</p>
        <p>You must remember the following points about denormalized properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Denormalized properties should never have any 
 kind of "object physical maps" created for them. Mapping a denormalized 
 property will generate SQL errors in the database and in the OnyxEdDataDownload 
 component that are difficult to debug.</li>
            <li>Denormalized properties should never be included 
 in the "key maps" of a relationship.</li>
            <li>Denormalized properties 
 should never be included in "object key" collections. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Onyx recommends setting the Read Only attribute for denormalization 
 definition properties. For more information, see the <a href="OED_Property.htm#ReadOnly">Read 
 Only attribute</a> section of the Properties topic.</p>
