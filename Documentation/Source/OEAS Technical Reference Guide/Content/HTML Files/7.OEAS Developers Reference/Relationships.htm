 how business objects are related to other business objects. The following 
 table summarizes the relationships metadata.</p>

        <p>The same two objects can be related using more than one relationship 
 when appropriate. For example, an individual can own an incident, but 
 an individual can also be the primary contact for an incident. This situation 
 requires the definition of two relationships between the individual and 
 incident objects. Note that individual is the primary object in both relationships.</p>
        <p>Relationships are used for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li>Implementing cascade deletes on transactional 
 objects</li>
            <li>Enforcing referential integrity between transactional 
 objects and for polymorphic relationships</li>
            <li>Determining how to retrieve property values from 
 one object to another (denormalization)</li>
            <li>Enforcing concurrency control between tightly-coupled 
 objects.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For instance, the incident object includes a relationship defined on 
 its ownerId property and the primaryId properties of company and individual 
 objects. These relationships are what define that the valid ownerType 
 values for incident are 1 and 2 (individual and company), and that when 
 an incident is created, the ownerId should be validated against existing 
 active data in the appropriate tables (individual and company).</p>
        <p>Relationship definitions appear in Object 
 Designer under the business Object node for the secondary object. </p>
