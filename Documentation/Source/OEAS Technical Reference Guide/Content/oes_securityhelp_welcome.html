        <h1>Welcome to Security Administration </h1>
        <p>Help for Security Administration contains procedures for accomplishing 
 tasks in the course of managing access permissions. </p>
        <p>For detailed instructions on using this tool, click <img src="Resources/Images/iconHelp0.jpg" /> to 
 access the Help system. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Quick overview </p>
        <p>The Security Administration interface has four main 
 areas: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The context area, which lists the tool you're 
 using (Security Administration) and the application you're connected to, 
 on which site.</li>
            <li>The toolbar, which contains command buttons you 
 can use to perform common tasks quickly.</li>
            <li>The navigation area (the left pane), which contains 
 a tree of the users, groups, roles, and resources that are available for 
 managing.</li>
            <li>The edit area (the right pane), where you manage 
 permissions and change the properties of users, groups, roles, and resources.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Following are the buttons on the Security Administration 
 toolbar and their uses: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click <img src="Resources/Images/iconAdd0.jpg" /> to add a new group, user, 
 or role.</li>
            <li>Click <img src="Resources/Images/iconDelete0.jpg" /> to delete a role or resource. 
 Note that the deletion does not actually occur until you click <img src="Resources/Images/iconSave0.jpg" /> You can only delete roles or resources. You cannot physically 
 delete a user or group; you can only deactivate it.</li>
            <li>Click <img src="Resources/Images/iconClone0.jpg" /> to create a user with the 
 same properties, including group and role membership but not including 
 access permissions, as the user that is selected when you create the new 
 user.</li>
            <li>Click  <img src="Resources/Images/iconuserpref0.jpg" />to change preferences for 
 Security Administration. Currently, the only preference that can be changed 
 is the default Onyx password for new users.</li>
            <li>Click <img src="Resources/Images/iconSave0.jpg" /> to save the changes that 
 you have made to groups, users, roles, and resources since you last opened 
 Security Administration or last saved changes. You can save several changes 
 with one click. However, Onyx recommends that you save changes as frequently 
 as is practically possible. </li>
        </ul>
