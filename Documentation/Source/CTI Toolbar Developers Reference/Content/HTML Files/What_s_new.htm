        <p class="BodyText">Onyx CTI has been updated to leverage the new SQL Generation (SQLGen) 
 architecture of the OEAS 6.0 platform. For more information about the 
 SQL generation platform, see the <span style="font-style: italic;">OEAS 
 Technical Reference</span>.</p>
        <p class="BodyText">The following changes have been made to the <a href="Business_objects_library.htm">Onyx 
 CTI business objects</a>: </p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;" type="disc">
            <li class="ListBullet">Existing methods have been replaced with the saveCollection 
 and retrieveCollection methods as is standard for Onyx 6.0. These methods 
 provide additional functionality for the objects. </li>
            <li class="ListBullet">The ctiAgentAssociation object is now a domain 
 data object (rather than a transactional object) and contains an active 
 property as is standard for Onyx 6.0.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet">The ctiConnector object no longer has the user1..N 
 properties. These properties were removed due to the improved handling 
 of object and table customization in the OEAS 6.0 platform. For more information 
 about customizing objects and tables, see the <span style="font-style: italic;">OEAS 
 Technical Reference</span>. </li>
